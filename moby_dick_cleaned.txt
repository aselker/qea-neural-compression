unpleasant enough_ it touches one_s sense of honour_ particularly if you come of an old established family in the land_ the van rensselaers_ or randolphs_ or hardicanutes_ and more than all_ if just previous to putting your hand into the tar_pot_ you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster_ making the tallest boys stand in awe of you_ the transition is a keen one_ i assure you_ from a schoolmaster to a sailor_ and requires a strong decoction of seneca and the stoics to enable you to grin and bear it_ but even this wears off in time_ what of it_ if some old hunks of a sea_captain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks_ what does that indignity amount to_ weighed_ i mean_ in the scales of the new testament_ do you think the archangel gabriel thinks anything the less of me_ because i promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance_ who ain_t a slave_ tell me that_ well_ then_ however the old sea_captains may order me about_however they may thump and punch me about_ i have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right_ that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way_either in a physical or metaphysical point of

paying and being paid_ the act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us_ but being paid__what will compare with it_ the urbane activity with which a man receives money is really marvellous_ considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills_ and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven_ ah_ how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition_ finally_ i always go to sea as a sailor_ because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of the fore_castle deck_ for as in this world_ head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern _that is_ if you never violate the pythagorean maxim__ so for the most part the commodore on the quarter_deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle_ he thinks he breathes it first_ but not so_ in much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things_ at the same time that the leaders little suspect it_ but wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor_ i should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage_ this the invisible police officer of the fates_ who has the constant surveillance of me_ and secretly dogs me_ and influences me in some unaccountable way_he can better answer than any one else_ and_ doubtless_ my going on this whaling voyage_ formed part

have run something like this_ _grand contested election for the presidency of the united states_ _whaling voyage by one ishmael_ _bloody battle in affghanistan__ though i cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers_ the fates_ put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage_ when others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies_ and short and easy parts in genteel comedies_ and jolly parts in farces_though i cannot tell why this was exactly_ yet_ now that i recall all the circumstances_ i think i can see a little into the springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises_ induced me to set about performing the part i did_ besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment_ chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself_ such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity_ then the wild and distant

december_ much was i disappointed upon learning that the little packet for nantucket had already sailed_ and that no way of reaching that place would offer_ till the following monday_ as most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at this same new bedford_ thence to embark on their voyage_ it may as well be related that i_ for one_ had no idea of so doing_ for my mind was made up to sail in no other than a nantucket craft_ because there was a fine_ boisterous something about everything connected with that famous old island_ which amazingly pleased me_ besides though new bedford has of late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling_ and though in this matter poor old nantucket is now much behind her_ yet nantucket was her great original_the tyre of this carthage__the place where the first dead american whale was stranded_ where else but from nantucket did those aboriginal whalemen_ the red_men_ first sally out in canoes to give chase to the leviathan_ and where but from nantucket_ too_ did that first adventurous little sloop put forth_ partly laden with imported cobblestones_so goes the story_to throw at the whales_ in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit_ now having a night_ a day_ and still another night following before me in new bedford_ ere i could embark for my destined port_ it became a matter of concernment where i was to eat and sleep meanwhile_ it was a very dubious_looking_ nay_ a very dark and dismal night_ bitingly cold and cheerless_ i knew no one in the place_ with anxious grapnels i had sounded my pocket_ and only brought up a few pieces of silver__so_ wherever you go_ ishmael_ said i to myself_ as i stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag_ and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the south_wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night_ my dear ishmael_ be sure to inquire the price_ and don_t be too particular_ with halting steps i paced the streets_ and passed the sign of _the crossed harpoons__but it looked too expensive and jolly there_ further on_ from the bright red windows of the _sword_fish inn__ there came such fervent rays_ that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house_ for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard_ asphaltic pavement__rather weary for me_ when i struck my foot against the flinty projections_ because from hard_ remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight_ too expensive and jolly_ again thought i_ pausing one moment to watch the broad glare in the street_ and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within_ but go on_ ishmael_ said i at last_ don_t you hear_ get away from before the door_ your patched boots are stopping the way_ so on i went_ i now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward_ for there_ doubtless_ were the cheapest_ if not the cheeriest inns_ such dreary streets_ blocks of blackness_ not houses_ on either hand_ and here and there a candle_ like a candle moving about in a tomb_ at this hour of the night_ of the last day of the week_ that quarter of the town proved all but deserted_ but presently i came to a smoky light proceeding from a low_ wide building_ the door of which stood invitingly open_ it had a careless look_ as if it were meant for the uses of the public_ so_ entering_ the first thing i did was to stumble over an ash_box in the porch_ ha_ thought i_ ha_ as the flying particles almost choked me_ are these ashes from that destroyed city_ gomorrah_ but _the crossed harpoons__ and _the sword_fish___this_ then must needs be the sign of _the trap__ however_ i picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within_ pushed on and opened a second_ interior door_ it seemed the great black parliament sitting in tophet_ a hundred black faces turned round in their rows to peer_ and beyond_ a black angel of doom was beating a book in a pulpit_ it was a negro church_ and the preacher_s text was about the blackness of darkness_ and the weeping and wailing and teeth_gnashing there_ ha_ ishmael_ muttered i_ backing out_ wretched entertainment at the sign of _the trap__ moving on_ i at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks_ and heard a forlorn creaking in the air_ and looking up_ saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it_ faintly representing a tall straight jet of misty spray_ and these words underneath__the spouter inn__peter coffin__ coffin__spouter__rather ominous in that particular connexion_ thought i_ but it is a common name in nantucket_ they say_ and i suppose this peter here is an emigrant from there_ as the light looked so dim_ and the place_ for the time_ looked quiet enough_ and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district_ and as the swinging sign had a poverty_stricken sort of creak to it_ i thought that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings_ and the best of pea coffee_ it was a queer sort of place_a gable_ended old house_ one side palsied as it were_ and leaning over sadly_ it stood on a sharp bleak corner_ where that tempestuous wind euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever it did about poor paul_s tossed craft_ euroclydon_ nevertheless_ is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in_doors_ with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed_ _in judging of that tempestuous wind called euroclydon__ says an old writer_of whose works i possess the only copy extant__it maketh a marvellous difference_ whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside_ or whether thou observest it from that sashless window_ where the frost is on both sides_ and of which the wight death is the only glazier__ true enough_ thought i_ as this passage occurred to my mind_old black_letter_ thou reasonest well_ yes_ these eyes are windows_ and this body of mine is the house_ what a pity they didn_t stop up the chinks and the crannies though_ and thrust in a little lint here and there_ but it_s too late to make any improvements now_ the universe is finished_ the copestone is on_ and the chips were carted off a million years ago_ poor lazarus there_ chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow_ and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings_ he might plug up both ears with rags_ and put a corn_cob into his mouth_ and yet that would not keep out the tempestuous euroclydon_ euroclydon_ says old dives_ in his red silken wrapper__he had a redder one afterwards_ pooh_ pooh_ what a fine frosty night_ how orion glitters_ what northern lights_ let them talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories_ give me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals_ but what thinks lazarus_ can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the grand northern lights_ would not lazarus rather be in sumatra than here_ would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of the equator_ yea_ ye gods_ go down to the fiery pit itself_ in order to keep out this frost_ now_ that lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the door of dives_ this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be moored to one of the moluccas_ yet dives himself_ he too lives like a czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs_ and being a president of a temperance society_ he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans_ but no more of this blubbering now_ we are going a_whaling_ and there is plenty of that yet to come_ let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet_ and see what sort of a place this _spouter_ may be_ chapter __ the spouter_inn_ entering that gable_ended spouter_inn_ you found yourself in a wide_ low_ straggling entry with old_fashioned wainscots_ reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft_ on one side hung a very large oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked_ and every way defaced_ that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it_ it was only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it_ and careful inquiry of the neighbors_ that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its purpose_ such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows_ that at first you almost thought some ambitious young artist_ in the time of the new england hags_ had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched_ but by dint of much and earnest contemplation_ and oft repeated ponderings_ and especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry_ you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea_ however wild_ might not be altogether unwarranted_ but what most puzzled and confounded you was a long_ limber_ portentous_ black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three blue_ dim_ perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast_ a boggy_ soggy_ squitchy picture truly_ enough to drive a nervous man distracted_ yet was there a sort of indefinite_ half_attained_ unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it_ till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant_ ever and anon a bright_ but_ alas_ deceptive idea would dart you through__it_s the black sea in a midnight gale__it_s the unnatural combat of the four primal elements__it_s a blasted heath__it_s a hyperborean winter scene__it_s the breaking_up of the icebound stream of time_ but at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in the picture_s midst_ that once found out_ and all the rest were plain_ but stop_ does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish_ even the great leviathan himself_ in fact_ the artist_s design seemed this_ a final theory of my own_ partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom i conversed upon the subject_ the picture represents a cape_horner in a great hurricane_ the half_foundered ship weltering there with its three dismantled masts alone visible_ and an exasperated whale_ purposing to spring clean over the craft_ is in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast_heads_ the opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array of monstrous clubs and spears_ some were thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory saws_ others were tufted with knots of human hair_ and one was sickle_shaped_ with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment made in the new_mown grass by a long_armed mower_ you shuddered as you gazed_ and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone a death_harvesting with such a hacking_ horrifying implement_ mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons all broken and deformed_ some were storied weapons_ with this once long lance_ now wildly elbowed_ fifty years ago did nathan swain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset_ and that harpoon_so like a corkscrew now_was flung in javan seas_ and run away with by a whale_ years afterwards slain off the cape of blanco_ the original iron entered nigh the tail_ and_ like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man_ travelled full forty feet_ and at last was found imbedded in the hump_ crossing this dusky entry_ and on through yon low_arched way_cut through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with fireplaces all round_you enter the public room_ a still duskier place is this_ with such low ponderous beams above_ and such old wrinkled planks beneath_ that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft_s cockpits_ especially of such a howling night_ when this corner_anchored old ark rocked so furiously_ on one side stood a long_ low_ shelf_like table covered with cracked glass cases_ filled with dusty rarities gathered from this wide world_s remotest nooks_ projecting from the further angle of the room stands a dark_looking den_the bar_a rude attempt at a right whale_s head_ be that how it may_ there stands the vast arched bone of the whale_s jaw_ so wide_ a coach might almost drive beneath it_ within are shabby shelves_ ranged round with old decanters_ bottles_ flasks_ and in those jaws of swift destruction_ like another cursed jonah _by which name indeed they called him__ bustles a little withered old man_ who_ for their money_ dearly sells the sailors deliriums and death_ abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison_ though true cylinders without_within_ the villanous green goggling glasses deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom_ parallel meridians rudely pecked into the glass_ surround these footpads_ goblets_ fill to this mark_ and your charge is but a penny_ to this a penny more_ and so on to the full glass_the cape horn measure_ which you may gulp down for a shilling_ upon entering the place i found a number of young seamen gathered about a table_ examining by a dim light divers specimens of skrimshander_ i sought the landlord_ and telling him i desired to be accommodated with a room_ received for answer that his house was full_not a bed unoccupied_ _but avast__ he added_ tapping his forehead_ _you haint no objections to sharing a harpooneer_s blanket_ have ye_ i s_pose you are goin_ a_whalin__ so you_d better get used to that sort of thing__ i told him that i never liked to sleep two in a bed_ that if i should ever do so_ it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be_ and that if he _the landlord_ really had no other place for me_ and the harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable_ why rather than wander further about a strange town on so bitter a night_ i would put up with the half of any decent man_s blanket_ _i thought so_ all right_ take a seat_ supper__you want supper_ supper_ll be ready directly__ i sat down on an old wooden settle_ carved all over like a bench on the battery_ at one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with his jack_knife_ stooping over and diligently working away at the space between his legs_ he was trying his hand at a ship under full sail_ but he didn_t make much headway_ i thought_ at last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an adjoining room_ it was cold as iceland_no fire at all_the landlord said he couldn_t afford it_ nothing but two dismal tallow candles_ each in a winding sheet_ we were fain to button up our monkey jackets_ and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers_ but the fare was of the most substantial kind_not only meat and potatoes_ but dumplings_ good heavens_ dumplings for supper_ one young fellow in a green box coat_ addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful manner_ _my boy__ said the landlord_ _you_ll have the nightmare to a dead sartainty__ _landlord__ i whispered_ _that aint the harpooneer is it__ _oh_ no__ said he_ looking a sort of diabolically funny_ _the harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap_ he never eats dumplings_ he don_t_he eats nothing but steaks_ and he likes _em rare__ _the devil he does__ says i_ _where is that harpooneer_ is he here__ _he_ll be here afore long__ was the answer_ i could not help it_ but i began to feel suspicious of this _dark complexioned_ harpooneer_ at any rate_ i made up my mind that if it so turned out that we should sleep together_ he must undress and get into bed before i did_ supper over_ the company went back to the bar_room_ when_ knowing not what else to do with myself_ i resolved to spend the rest of the evening as a looker on_ presently a rioting noise was heard without_ starting up_ the landlord cried_ _that_s the grampus_s crew_ i seed her reported in the offing this morning_ a three years_ voyage_ and a full ship_ hurrah_ boys_ now we_ll have the latest news from the feegees__ a tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry_ the door was flung open_ and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough_ enveloped in their shaggy watch coats_ and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters_ all bedarned and ragged_ and their beards stiff with icicles_ they seemed an eruption of bears from labrador_ they had just landed from their boat_ and this was the first house they entered_ no wonder_ then_ that they made a straight wake for the whale_s mouth_the bar_when the wrinkled little old jonah_ there officiating_ soon poured them out brimmers all round_ one complained of a bad cold in his head_ upon which jonah mixed him a pitch_like potion of gin and molasses_ which he swore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever_ never mind of how long standing_ or whether caught off the coast of labrador_ or on the weather side of an ice_island_ the liquor soon mounted into their heads_ as it generally does even with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea_ and they began capering about most obstreperously_ i observed_ however_ that one of them held somewhat aloof_ and though he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own sober face_ yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise as the rest_ this man interested me at once_ and since the sea_gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate _though but a sleeping_partner one_ so far as this narrative is concerned__ i will here venture upon a little description of him_ he stood full six feet in height_ with noble shoulders_ and a chest like a coffer_dam_ i have seldom seen such brawn in a man_ his face was deeply brown and burnt_ making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast_ while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy_ his voice at once announced that he was a southerner_ and from his fine stature_ i thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the alleghanian ridge in virginia_ when the revelry of his companions had mounted to its height_ this man slipped away unobserved_ and i saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea_ in a few minutes_ however_ he was missed by his shipmates_ and being_ it seems_ for some reason a huge favourite with them_ they raised a cry of _bulkington_ bulkington_ where_s bulkington__ and darted out of the house in pursuit of him_ it was now about nine o_clock_ and the room seeming almost supernaturally quiet after these orgies_ i began to congratulate myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seamen_ no man prefers to sleep two in a bed_ in fact_ you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother_ i don_t know how it is_ but people like to be private when they are sleeping_ and when it comes to sleeping with an unknown stranger_ in a strange inn_ in a strange town_ and that stranger a harpooneer_ then your objections indefinitely multiply_ nor was there any earthly reason why i as a sailor should sleep two in a bed_ more than anybody else_ for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea_ than bachelor kings do ashore_ to be sure they all sleep together in one apartment_ but you have your own hammock_ and cover yourself with your own blanket_ and sleep in your own skin_ the more i pondered over this harpooneer_ the more i abominated the thought of sleeping with him_ it was fair to presume that being a harpooneer_ his linen or woollen_ as the case might be_ would not be of the tidiest_ certainly none of the finest_ i began to twitch all over_ besides_ it was getting late_ and my decent harpooneer ought to be home and going bedwards_ suppose now_ he should tumble in upon me at midnight_how could i tell from what vile hole he had been coming_ _landlord_ i_ve changed my mind about that harpooneer__i shan_t sleep with him_ i_ll try the bench here__ _just as you please_ i_m sorry i can_t spare ye a tablecloth for a mattress_ and it_s a plaguy rough board here__feeling of the knots and notches_ _but wait a bit_ skrimshander_ i_ve got a carpenter_s plane there in the bar_wait_ i say_ and i_ll make ye snug enough__ so saying he procured the plane_ and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting the bench_ vigorously set to planing away at my bed_ the while grinning like an ape_ the shavings flew right and left_ till at last the plane_iron came bump against an indestructible knot_ the landlord was near spraining his wrist_ and i told him for heaven_s sake to quit_the bed was soft enough to suit me_ and i did not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a pine plank_ so gathering up the shavings with another grin_ and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room_ he went about his business_ and left me in a brown study_ i now took the measure of the bench_ and found that it was a foot too short_ but that could be mended with a chair_ but it was a foot too narrow_ and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher than the planed one_so there was no yoking them_ i then placed the first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall_ leaving a little interval between_ for my back to settle down in_ but i soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under the sill of the window_ that this plan would never do at all_ especially as another current from the rickety door met the one from the window_ and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where i had thought to spend the night_ the devil fetch that harpooneer_ thought i_ but stop_ couldn_t i steal a march on him_bolt his door inside_ and jump into his bed_ not to be wakened by the most violent knockings_ it seemed no bad idea_ but upon second thoughts i dismissed it_ for who could tell but what the next morning_ so soon as i popped out of the room_ the harpooneer might be standing in the entry_ all ready to knock me down_ still_ looking round me again_ and seeing no possible chance of spending a sufferable night unless in some other person_s bed_ i began to think that after all i might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this unknown harpooneer_ thinks i_ i_ll wait awhile_ he must be dropping in before long_ i_ll have a good look at him then_ and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after all_there_s no telling_ but though the other boarders kept coming in by ones_ twos_ and threes_ and going to bed_ yet no sign of my harpooneer_ _landlord__ said i_ _what sort of a chap is he_does he always keep such late hours__ it was now hard upon twelve o_clock_ the landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle_ and seemed to be mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension_ _no__ he answered_ _generally he_s an early bird_airley to bed and airley to rise_yes_ he_s the bird what catches the worm_ but to_night he went out a peddling_ you see_ and i don_t see what on airth keeps him so late_ unless_ may be_ he can_t sell his head__ _can_t sell his head__what sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are telling me__ getting into a towering rage_ _do you pretend to say_ landlord_ that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed saturday night_ or rather sunday morning_ in peddling his head around this town__ _that_s precisely it__ said the landlord_ _and i told him he couldn_t sell it here_ the market_s overstocked__ _with what__ shouted i_ _with heads to be sure_ ain_t there too many heads in the world__ _i tell you what it is_ landlord__ said i quite calmly_ _you_d better stop spinning that yarn to me_i_m not green__ _may be not__ taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick_ _but i rayther guess you_ll be done brown if that ere harpooneer hears you a slanderin_ his head__ _i_ll break it for him__ said i_ now flying into a passion again at this unaccountable farrago of the landlord_s_ _it_s broke a_ready__ said he_ _broke__ said i__broke_ do you mean__ _sartain_ and that_s the very reason he can_t sell it_ i guess__ _landlord__ said i_ going up to him as cool as mt_ hecla in a snow_storm__landlord_ stop whittling_ you and i must understand one another_ and that too without delay_ i come to your house and want a bed_ you tell me you can only give me half a one_ that the other half belongs to a certain harpooneer_ and about this harpooneer_ whom i have not yet seen_ you persist in telling me the most mystifying and exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow_a sort of connexion_ landlord_ which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest degree_ i now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this harpooneer is_ and whether i shall be in all respects safe to spend the night with him_ and in the first place_ you will be so good as to unsay that story about selling his head_ which if true i take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad_ and i_ve no idea of sleeping with a madman_ and you_ sir_ you i mean_ landlord_ you_ sir_ by trying to induce me to do so knowingly_ would thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution__ _wall__ said the landlord_ fetching a long breath_ _that_s a purty long sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then_ but be easy_ be easy_ this here harpooneer i have been tellin_ you of has just arrived from the south seas_ where he bought up a lot of _balmed new zealand heads _great curios_ you know__ and he_s sold all on _em but one_ and that one he_s trying to sell to_night_ cause to_morrow_s sunday_ and it would not do to be sellin_ human heads about the streets when folks is goin_ to churches_ he wanted to_ last sunday_ but i stopped him just as he was goin_ out of the door with four heads strung on a string_ for all the airth like a string of inions__ this account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery_ and showed that the landlord_ after all_ had had no idea of fooling me_but at the same time what could i think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a saturday night clean into the holy sabbath_ engaged in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators_ _depend upon it_ landlord_ that harpooneer is a dangerous man__ _he pays reg_lar__ was the rejoinder_ _but come_ it_s getting dreadful late_ you had better be turning flukes_it_s a nice bed_ sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced_ there_s plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed_ it_s an almighty big bed that_ why_ afore we give it up_ sal used to put our sam and little johnny in the foot of it_ but i got a dreaming and sprawling about one night_ and somehow_ sam got pitched on the floor_ and came near breaking his arm_ arter that_ sal said it wouldn_t do_ come along here_ i_ll give ye a glim in a jiffy__ and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards me_ offering to lead the way_ but i stood irresolute_ when looking at a clock in the corner_ he exclaimed _i vum it_s sunday_you won_t see that harpooneer to_night_ he_s come to anchor somewhere_come along then_ do come_ won_t ye come__ i considered the matter a moment_ and then up stairs we went_ and i was ushered into a small room_ cold as a clam_ and furnished_ sure enough_ with a prodigious bed_ almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers to sleep abreast_ _there__ said the landlord_ placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest that did double duty as a wash_stand and centre table_ _there_ make yourself comfortable now_ and good night to ye__ i turned round from eyeing the bed_ but he had disappeared_ folding back the counterpane_ i stooped over the bed_ though none of the most elegant_ it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well_ i then glanced round the room_ and besides the bedstead and centre table_ could see no other furniture belonging to the place_ but a rude shelf_ the four walls_ and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale_ of things not properly belonging to the room_ there was a hammock lashed up_ and thrown upon the floor in one corner_ also a large seaman_s bag_ containing the harpooneer_s wardrobe_ no doubt in lieu of a land trunk_ likewise_ there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the fire_place_ and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed_ but what is this on the chest_ i took it up_ and held it close to the light_ and felt it_ and smelt it_ and tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it_ i can compare it to nothing but a large door mat_ ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an indian moccasin_ there was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat_ as you see the same in south american ponchos_ but could it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat_ and parade the streets of any christian town in that sort of guise_ i put it on_ to try it_ and it weighed me down like a hamper_ being uncommonly shaggy and thick_ and i thought a little damp_ as though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day_ i went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall_ and i never saw such a sight in my life_ i tore myself out of it in such a hurry that i gave myself a kink in the neck_ i sat down on the side of the bed_ and commenced thinking about this head_peddling harpooneer_ and his door mat_ after thinking some time on the bed_side_ i got up and took off my monkey jacket_ and then stood in the middle of the room thinking_ i then took off my coat_ and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves_ but beginning to feel very cold now_ half undressed as i was_ and remembering what the landlord said about the harpooneer_s not coming home at all that night_ it being so very late_ i made no more ado_ but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots_ and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed_ and commended myself to the care of heaven_ whether that mattress was stuffed with corn_cobs or broken crockery_ there is no telling_ but i rolled about a good deal_ and could not sleep for a long time_ at last i slid off into a light doze_ and had pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of nod_ when i heard a heavy footfall in the passage_ and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under the door_ lord save me_ thinks i_ that must be the harpooneer_ the infernal head_peddler_ but i lay perfectly still_ and resolved not to say a word till spoken to_ holding a light in one hand_ and that identical new zealand head in the other_ the stranger entered the room_ and without looking towards the bed_ placed his candle a good way off from me on the floor in one corner_ and then began working away at the knotted cords of the large bag i before spoke of as being in the room_ i was all eagerness to see his face_ but he kept it averted for some time while employed in unlacing the bag_s mouth_ this accomplished_ however_ he turned round_when_ good heavens_ what a sight_ such a face_ it was of a dark_ purplish_ yellow colour_ here and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares_ yes_ it_s just as i thought_ he_s a terrible bedfellow_ he_s been in a fight_ got dreadfully cut_ and here he is_ just from the surgeon_ but at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light_ that i plainly saw they could not be sticking_plasters at all_ those black squares on his cheeks_ they were stains of some sort or other_ at first i knew not what to make of this_ but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me_ i remembered a story of a white man_a whaleman too_who_ falling among the cannibals_ had been tattooed by them_ i concluded that this harpooneer_ in the course of his distant voyages_ must have met with a similar adventure_ and what is it_ thought i_ after all_ it_s only his outside_ a man can be honest in any sort of skin_ but then_ what to make of his unearthly complexion_ that part of it_ i mean_ lying round about_ and completely independent of the squares of tattooing_ to be sure_ it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning_ but i never heard of a hot sun_s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one_ however_ i had never been in the south seas_ and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin_ now_ while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning_ this harpooneer never noticed me at all_ but_ after some difficulty having opened his bag_ he commenced fumbling in it_ and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk_ and a seal_skin wallet with the hair on_ placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room_ he then took the new zealand head_a ghastly thing enough_and crammed it down into the bag_ he now took off his hat_a new beaver hat_when i came nigh singing out with fresh surprise_ there was no hair on his head_none to speak of at least_nothing but a small scalp_knot twisted up on his forehead_ his bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull_ had not the stranger stood between me and the door_ i would have bolted out of it quicker than ever i bolted a dinner_ even as it was_ i thought something of slipping out of the window_ but it was the second floor back_ i am no coward_ but what to make of this head_peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension_ ignorance is the parent of fear_ and being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger_ i confess i was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night_ in fact_ i was so afraid of him that i was not game enough just then to address him_ and demand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him_ meanwhile_ he continued the business of undressing_ and at last showed his chest and arms_ as i live_ these covered parts of him were checkered with the same squares as his face_ his back_ too_ was all over the same dark squares_ he seemed to have been in a thirty years_ war_ and just escaped from it with a sticking_plaster shirt_ still more_ his very legs were marked_ as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of young palms_ it was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the south seas_ and so landed in this christian country_ i quaked to think of it_ a peddler of heads too_perhaps the heads of his own brothers_ he might take a fancy to mine_heavens_ look at that tomahawk_ but there was no time for shuddering_ for now the savage went about something that completely fascinated my attention_ and convinced me that he must indeed be a heathen_ going to his heavy grego_ or wrapall_ or dreadnaught_ which he had previously hung on a chair_ he fumbled in the pockets_ and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a hunch on its back_ and exactly the colour of a three days_ old congo baby_ remembering the embalmed head_ at first i almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner_ but seeing that it was not at all limber_ and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony_ i concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol_ which indeed it proved to be_ for now the savage goes up to the empty fire_place_ and removing the papered fire_board_ sets up this little hunch_backed image_ like a tenpin_ between the andirons_ the chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty_ so that i thought this fire_place made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel for his congo idol_ i now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image_ feeling but ill at ease meantime_to see what was next to follow_ first he takes about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket_ and places them carefully before the idol_ then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp_ he kindled the shavings into a sacrificial blaze_ presently_ after many hasty snatches into the fire_ and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers _whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly__ he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit_ then blowing off the heat and ashes a little_ he made a polite offer of it to the little negro_ but the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all_ he never moved his lips_ all these strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee_ who seemed to be praying in a sing_song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other_ during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner_ at last extinguishing the fire_ he took the idol up very unceremoniously_ and bagged it again in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock_ all these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness_ and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations_ and jumping into bed with me_ i thought it was high time_ now or never_ before the light was put out_ to break the spell in which i had so long been bound_ but the interval i spent in deliberating what to say_ was a fatal one_ taking up his tomahawk from the table_ he examined the head of it for an instant_ and then holding it to the light_ with his mouth at the handle_ he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke_ the next moment the light was extinguished_ and this wild cannibal_ tomahawk between his teeth_ sprang into bed with me_ i sang out_ i could not help it now_ and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me_ stammering out something_ i knew not what_ i rolled away from him against the wall_ and then conjured him_ whoever or whatever he might be_ to keep quiet_ and let me get up and light the lamp again_ but his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning_ _who_e debel you___he at last said__you no speak_e_ dam_me_ i kill_e__ and so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark_ _landlord_ for god_s sake_ peter coffin__ shouted i_ _landlord_ watch_ coffin_ angels_ save me__ _speak_e_ tell_ee me who_ee be_ or dam_me_ i kill_e__ again growled the cannibal_ while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ashes about me till i thought my linen would get on fire_ but thank heaven_ at that moment the landlord came into the room light in hand_ and leaping from the bed i ran up to him_ _don_t be afraid now__ said he_ grinning again_ _queequeg here wouldn_t harm a hair of your head__ _stop your grinning__ shouted i_ _and why didn_t you tell me that that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal__ _i thought ye know_d it__didn_t i tell ye_ he was a peddlin_ heads around town__but turn flukes again and go to sleep_ queequeg_ look here_you sabbee me_ i sabbee_you this man sleepe you_you sabbee__ _me sabbee plenty__grunted queequeg_ puffing away at his pipe and sitting up in bed_ _you gettee in__ he added_ motioning to me with his tomahawk_ and throwing the clothes to one side_ he really did this in not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way_ i stood looking at him a moment_ for all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean_ comely looking cannibal_ what_s all this fuss i have been making about_ thought i to myself_the man_s a human being just as i am_ he has just as much reason to fear me_ as i have to be afraid of him_ better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken christian_ _landlord__ said i_ _tell him to stash his tomahawk there_ or pipe_ or whatever you call it_ tell him to stop smoking_ in short_ and i will turn in with him_ but i don_t fancy having a man smoking in bed with me_ it_s dangerous_ besides_ i ain_t insured__ this being told to queequeg_ he at once complied_ and again politely motioned me to get into bed_rolling over to one side as much as to say__i won_t touch a leg of ye__ _good night_ landlord__ said i_ _you may go__ i turned in_ and never slept better in my life_ chapter __ the counterpane_ upon waking next morning about daylight_ i found queequeg_s arm thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner_ you had almost thought i had been his wife_ the counterpane was of patchwork_ full of odd little parti_coloured squares and triangles_ and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable cretan labyrinth of a figure_ no two parts of which were of one precise shade_owing i suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade_ his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times_this same arm of his_ i say_ looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt_ indeed_ partly lying on it as the arm did when i first awoke_ i could hardly tell it from the quilt_ they so blended their hues together_ and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that i could tell that queequeg was hugging me_ my sensations were strange_ let me try to explain them_ when i was a child_ i well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me_ whether it was a reality or a dream_ i never could entirely settle_ the circumstance was this_ i had been cutting up some caper or other_i think it was trying to crawl up the chimney_ as i had seen a little sweep do a few days previous_ and my stepmother who_ somehow or other_ was all the time whipping me_ or sending me to bed supperless__my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to bed_ though it was only two o_clock in the afternoon of the __st june_ the longest day in the year in our hemisphere_ i felt dreadfully_ but there was no help for it_ so up stairs i went to my little room in the third floor_ undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time_ and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets_ i lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse before i could hope for a resurrection_ sixteen hours in bed_ the small of my back ached to think of it_ and it was so light too_ the sun shining in at the window_ and a great rattling of coaches in the streets_ and the sound of gay voices all over the house_ i felt worse and worse_at last i got up_ dressed_ and softly going down in my stockinged feet_ sought out my stepmother_ and suddenly threw myself at her feet_ beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good slippering for my misbehaviour_ anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time_ but she was the best and most conscientious of stepmothers_ and back i had to go to my room_ for several hours i lay there broad awake_ feeling a great deal worse than i have ever done since_ even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes_ at last i must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze_ and slowly waking from it_half steeped in dreams_i opened my eyes_ and the before sun_lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness_ instantly i felt a shock running through all my frame_ nothing was to be seen_ and nothing was to be heard_ but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine_ my arm hung over the counterpane_ and the nameless_ unimaginable_ silent form or phantom_ to which the hand belonged_ seemed closely seated by my bed_side_ for what seemed ages piled on ages_ i lay there_ frozen with the most awful fears_ not daring to drag away my hand_ yet ever thinking that if i could but stir it one single inch_ the horrid spell would be broken_ i knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me_ but waking in the morning_ i shudderingly remembered it all_ and for days and weeks and months afterwards i lost myself in confounding attempts to explain the mystery_ nay_ to this very hour_ i often puzzle myself with it_ now_ take away the awful fear_ and my sensations at feeling the supernatural hand in mine were very similar_ in their strangeness_ to those which i experienced on waking up and seeing queequeg_s pagan arm thrown round me_ but at length all the past night_s events soberly recurred_ one by one_ in fixed reality_ and then i lay only alive to the comical predicament_ for though i tried to move his arm_unlock his bridegroom clasp_yet_ sleeping as he was_ he still hugged me tightly_ as though naught but death should part us twain_ i now strove to rouse him__queequeg___but his only answer was a snore_ i then rolled over_ my neck feeling as if it were in a horse_collar_ and suddenly felt a slight scratch_ throwing aside the counterpane_ there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage_s side_ as if it were a hatchet_faced baby_ a pretty pickle_ truly_ thought i_ abed here in a strange house in the broad day_ with a cannibal and a tomahawk_ _queequeg__in the name of goodness_ queequeg_ wake__ at length_ by dint of much wriggling_ and loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style_ i succeeded in extracting a grunt_ and presently_ he drew back his arm_ shook himself all over like a newfoundland dog just from the water_ and sat up in bed_ stiff as a pike_staff_ looking at me_ and rubbing his eyes as if he did not altogether remember how i came to be there_ though a dim consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him_ meanwhile_ i lay quietly eyeing him_ having no serious misgivings now_ and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature_ when_ at last_ his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow_ and he became_ as it were_ reconciled to the fact_ he jumped out upon the floor_ and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that_ if it pleased me_ he would dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards_ leaving the whole apartment to myself_ thinks i_ queequeg_ under the circumstances_ this is a very civilized overture_ but_ the truth is_ these savages have an innate sense of delicacy_ say what you will_ it is marvellous how essentially polite they are_ i pay this particular compliment to queequeg_ because he treated me with so much civility and consideration_ while i was guilty of great rudeness_ staring at him from the bed_ and watching all his toilette motions_ for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding_ nevertheless_ a man like queequeg you don_t see every day_ he and his ways were well worth unusual regarding_ he commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat_ a very tall one_ by the by_ and then_still minus his trowsers_he hunted up his boots_ what under the heavens he did it for_ i cannot tell_ but his next movement was to crush himself_boots in hand_ and hat on_under the bed_ when_ from sundry violent gaspings and strainings_ i inferred he was hard at work booting himself_ though by no law of propriety that i ever heard of_ is any man required to be private when putting on his boots_ but queequeg_ do you see_ was a creature in the transition stage_neither caterpillar nor butterfly_ he was just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners_ his education was not yet completed_ he was an undergraduate_ if he had not been a small degree civilized_ he very probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all_ but then_ if he had not been still a savage_ he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on_ at last_ he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes_ and began creaking and limping about the room_ as if_ not being much accustomed to boots_ his pair of damp_ wrinkled cowhide ones_probably not made to order either_rather pinched and tormented him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning_ seeing_ now_ that there were no curtains to the window_ and that the street being very narrow_ the house opposite commanded a plain view into the room_ and observing more and more the indecorous figure that queequeg made_ staving about with little else but his hat and boots on_ i begged him as well as i could_ to accelerate his toilet somewhat_ and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible_ he complied_ and then proceeded to wash himself_ at that time in the morning any christian would have washed his face_ but queequeg_ to my amazement_ contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his chest_ arms_ and hands_ he then donned his waistcoat_ and taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash_stand centre table_ dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face_ i was watching to see where he kept his razor_ when lo and behold_ he takes the harpoon from the bed corner_ slips out the long wooden stock_ unsheathes the head_ whets it a little on his boot_ and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall_ begins a vigorous scraping_ or rather harpooning of his cheeks_ thinks i_ queequeg_ this is using rogers_s best cutlery with a vengeance_ afterwards i wondered the less at this operation when i came to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made_ and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept_ the rest of his toilet was soon achieved_ and he proudly marched out of the room_ wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket_ and sporting his harpoon like a marshal_s baton_ chapter __ breakfast_ i quickly followed suit_ and descending into the bar_room accosted the grinning landlord very pleasantly_ i cherished no malice towards him_ though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my bedfellow_ however_ a good laugh is a mighty good thing_ and rather too scarce a good thing_ the more_s the pity_ so_ if any one man_ in his own proper person_ afford stuff for a good joke to anybody_ let him not be backward_ but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in that way_ and the man that has anything bountifully laughable about him_ be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for_ the bar_room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the night previous_ and whom i had not as yet had a good look at_ they were nearly all whalemen_ chief mates_ and second mates_ and third mates_ and sea carpenters_ and sea coopers_ and sea blacksmiths_ and harpooneers_ and ship keepers_ a brown and brawny company_ with bosky beards_ an unshorn_ shaggy set_ all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns_ you could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore_ this young fellow_s healthy cheek is like a sun_toasted pear in hue_ and would seem to smell almost as musky_ he cannot have been three days landed from his indian voyage_ that man next him looks a few shades lighter_ you might say a touch of satin wood is in him_ in the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn_ but slightly bleached withal_ he doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore_ but who could show a cheek like queequeg_ which_ barred with various tints_ seemed like the andes_ western slope_ to show forth in one array_ contrasting climates_ zone by zone_ _grub_ ho__ now cried the landlord_ flinging open a door_ and in we went to breakfast_ they say that men who have seen the world_ thereby become quite at ease in manner_ quite self_possessed in company_ not always_ though_ ledyard_ the great new england traveller_ and mungo park_ the scotch one_ of all men_ they possessed the least assurance in the parlor_ but perhaps the mere crossing of siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as ledyard did_ or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach_ in the negro heart of africa_ which was the sum of poor mungo_s performances_this kind of travel_ i say_ may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social polish_ still_ for the most part_ that sort of thing is to be had anywhere_ these reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after we were all seated at the table_ and i was preparing to hear some good stories about whaling_ to my no small surprise_ nearly every man maintained a profound silence_ and not only that_ but they looked embarrassed_ yes_ here were a set of sea_dogs_ many of whom without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas_entire strangers to them_and duelled them dead without winking_ and yet_ here they sat at a social breakfast table_all of the same calling_ all of kindred tastes_looking round as sheepishly at each other as though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the green mountains_ a curious sight_ these bashful bears_ these timid warrior whalemen_ but as for queequeg_why_ queequeg sat there among them_at the head of the table_ too_ it so chanced_ as cool as an icicle_ to be sure i cannot say much for his breeding_ his greatest admirer could not have cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him_ and using it there without ceremony_ reaching over the table with it_ to the imminent jeopardy of many heads_ and grappling the beefsteaks towards him_ but that was certainly very coolly done by him_ and every one knows that in most people_s estimation_ to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly_ we will not speak of all queequeg_s peculiarities here_ how he eschewed coffee and hot rolls_ and applied his undivided attention to beefsteaks_ done rare_ enough_ that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the rest into the public room_ lighted his tomahawk_pipe_ and was sitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on_ when i sallied out for a stroll_ chapter __ the street_ if i had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an individual as queequeg circulating among the polite society of a civilized town_ that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through the streets of new bedford_ in thoroughfares nigh the docks_ any considerable seaport will frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign parts_ even in broadway and chestnut streets_ mediterranean mariners will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies_ regent street is not unknown to lascars and malays_ and at bombay_ in the apollo green_ live yankees have often scared the natives_ but new bedford beats all water street and wapping_ in these last_mentioned haunts you see only sailors_ but in new bedford_ actual cannibals stand chatting at street corners_ savages outright_ many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh_ it makes a stranger stare_ but_ besides the feegeeans_ tongatobooarrs_ erromanggoans_ pannangians_ and brighggians_ and_ besides the wild specimens of the whaling_craft which unheeded reel about the streets_ you will see other sights still more curious_ certainly more comical_ there weekly arrive in this town scores of green vermonters and new hampshire men_ all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery_ they are mostly young_ of stalwart frames_ fellows who have felled forests_ and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the whale_lance_ many are as green as the green mountains whence they came_ in some things you would think them but a few hours old_ look there_ that chap strutting round the corner_ he wears a beaver hat and swallow_tailed coat_ girdled with a sailor_belt and sheath_knife_ here comes another with a sou__wester and a bombazine cloak_ no town_bred dandy will compare with a country_bred one_i mean a downright bumpkin dandy_a fellow that_ in the dog_days_ will mow his two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands_ now when a country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished reputation_ and joins the great whale_fishery_ you should see the comical things he does upon reaching the seaport_ in bespeaking his sea_outfit_ he orders bell_buttons to his waistcoats_ straps to his canvas trowsers_ ah_ poor hay_seed_ how bitterly will burst those straps in the first howling gale_ when thou art driven_ straps_ buttons_ and all_ down the throat of the tempest_ but think not that this famous town has only harpooneers_ cannibals_ and bumpkins to show her visitors_ not at all_ still new bedford is a queer place_ had it not been for us whalemen_ that tract of land would this day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of labrador_ as it is_ parts of her back country are enough to frighten one_ they look so bony_ the town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in_ in all new england_ it is a land of oil_ true enough_ but not like canaan_ a land_ also_ of corn and wine_ the streets do not run with milk_ nor in the spring_time do they pave them with fresh eggs_ yet_ in spite of this_ nowhere in all america will you find more patrician_like houses_ parks and gardens more opulent_ than in new bedford_ whence came they_ how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of a country_ go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty mansion_ and your question will be answered_ yes_ all these brave houses and flowery gardens came from the atlantic_ pacific_ and indian oceans_ one and all_ they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of the sea_ can herr alexander perform a feat like that_ in new bedford_ fathers_ they say_ give whales for dowers to their daughters_ and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a_piece_ you must go to new bedford to see a brilliant wedding_ for_ they say_ they have reservoirs of oil in every house_ and every night recklessly burn their lengths in spermaceti candles_ in summer time_ the town is sweet to see_ full of fine maples_long avenues of green and gold_ and in august_ high in air_ the beautiful and bountiful horse_chestnuts_ candelabra_wise_ proffer the passer_by their tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms_ so omnipotent is art_ which in many a district of new bedford has superinduced bright terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at creation_s

drawing nigh the odorous moluccas instead of the puritanic sands_ chapter __ the chapel_ in this same new bedford there stands a whaleman_s chapel_ and few are the moody fishermen_ shortly bound for the indian ocean or pacific_ who fail to make a sunday visit to the spot_ i am sure that i did not_ returning from my first morning stroll_ i again sallied out upon this special errand_ the sky had changed from clear_ sunny cold_ to driving sleet and mist_ wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called bearskin_ i fought my way against the stubborn storm_ entering_ i found a small scattered congregation of sailors_ and sailors_ wives and widows_ a muffled silence reigned_ only broken at times by the shrieks of the storm_ each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from the other_ as if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable_ the chaplain had not yet arrived_ and there these silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets_ with black borders_ masoned into the wall on either side the pulpit_ three of them ran something like the following_ but i do not pretend to quote__ sacred to the memory of john talbot_ who_ at the age of eighteen_ was lost overboard_ near the isle of desolation_ off patagonia_ november _st_ _____ this tablet is erected to his memory by his sister_ sacred to the memory of robert long_

pacific_ december __st_ _____ this marble is here placed by their surviving shipmates_ sacred to the memory of the late captain ezekiel hardy_ who in the bows of his boat was killed by a sperm whale on the coast of japan_ august _d_ _____ this tablet is erected to his memory by his widow_ shaking off the sleet from my ice_glazed hat and jacket_ i seated myself near the door_ and turning sideways was surprised to see queequeg near me_ affected by the solemnity of the scene_ there was a wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance_ this savage was the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance_ because he was the only one who could not read_ and_ therefore_ was not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall_ whether any of the relatives of the seamen whose names appeared there were now among the congregation_ i knew not_ but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery_ and so plainly did several women present wear the countenance if not the trappings of some unceasing grief_ that i feel sure that here before me were assembled those_ in whose unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed afresh_ oh_ ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass_ who standing among flowers can say_here_ here lies my beloved_ ye know not the desolation that broods in bosoms like these_ what bitter blanks in those black_bordered marbles which cover no ashes_ what despair in those immovable inscriptions_ what deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all faith_ and refuse resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished without a grave_ as well might those tablets stand in the cave of elephanta as here_ in what census of living creatures_ the dead of mankind are included_ why it is that a universal proverb says of them_ that they tell no tales_ though containing more secrets than the goodwin sands_ how it is that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world_ we prefix so significant and infidel a word_ and yet do not thus entitle him_ if he but embarks for the remotest indies of this living earth_ why the life insurance companies pay death_forfeitures upon immortals_ in what eternal_ unstirring paralysis_ and deadly_ hopeless trance_ yet lies antique adam who died sixty round centuries ago_ how it is that we still refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are dwelling in unspeakable bliss_ why all the living so strive to hush all the dead_ wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city_ all these things are not without their meanings_ but faith_ like a jackal_ feeds among the tombs_ and even from these dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope_ it needs scarcely to be told_ with what feelings_ on the eve of a nantucket voyage_ i regarded those marble tablets_ and by the murky light of that darkened_ doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who had gone before me_ yes_ ishmael_ the same fate may be thine_ but somehow i grew merry again_ delightful inducements to embark_ fine chance for promotion_ it seems_aye_ a stove boat will make me an immortal by brevet_ yes_ there is death in this business of whaling_a speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into eternity_ but what then_ methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of life and death_ methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true substance_ methinks that in looking at things spiritual_ we are too much like oysters observing the sun through the water_ and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air_ methinks my body is but the lees of my better being_ in fact take my body who will_ take it i say_ it is not me_ and therefore three cheers for nantucket_ and come a stove boat and stove body when they will_ for stave my soul_ jove himself cannot_ chapter __ the pulpit_ i had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable robustness entered_ immediately as the storm_pelted door flew back upon admitting him_ a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation_ sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain_ yes_ it was the famous father mapple_ so called by the whalemen_ among whom he was a very great favourite_ he had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth_ but for many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry_ at the time i now write of_ father mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age_ that sort of old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth_ for among all the fissures of his wrinkles_ there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing bloom_the spring verdure peeping forth even beneath february_s snow_ no one having previously heard his history_ could for the first time behold father mapple without the utmost interest_ because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him_ imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led_ when he entered i observed that he carried no umbrella_ and certainly had not come in his carriage_ for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet_ and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had absorbed_ however_ hat and coat and overshoes were one by one removed_ and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner_ when_ arrayed in a decent suit_ he quietly approached the pulpit_ like most old fashioned pulpits_ it was a very lofty one_ and since a regular stairs to such a height would_ by its long angle with the floor_ seriously contract the already small area of the chapel_ the architect_ it seemed_ had acted upon the hint of father mapple_ and finished the pulpit without a stairs_ substituting a perpendicular side ladder_ like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea_ the wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted man_ropes for this ladder_ which_ being itself nicely headed_ and stained with a mahogany colour_ the whole contrivance_ considering what manner of chapel it was_ seemed by no means in bad taste_ halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder_ and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the man_ropes_ father mapple cast a look upwards_ and then with a truly sailor_like but still reverential dexterity_ hand over hand_ mounted the steps as if ascending the main_top of his vessel_ the perpendicular parts of this side ladder_ as is usually the case with swinging ones_ were of cloth_covered rope_ only the rounds were of wood_ so that at every step there was a joint_ at my first glimpse of the pulpit_ it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship_ these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary_ for i was not prepared to see father mapple after gaining the height_ slowly turn round_ and stooping over the pulpit_ deliberately drag up the ladder step by step_ till the whole was deposited within_ leaving him impregnable in his little quebec_ i pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this_ father mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity_ that i could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of the stage_ no_ thought i_ there must be some sober reason for this thing_ furthermore_ it must symbolize something unseen_ can it be_ then_ that by that act of physical isolation_ he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time_ from all outward worldly ties and connexions_ yes_ for replenished with the meat and wine of the word_ to the faithful man of god_ this pulpit_ i see_ is a self_containing stronghold_a lofty ehrenbreitstein_ with a perennial well of water within the walls_ but the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place_ borrowed from the chaplain_s former sea_farings_ between the marble cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit_ the wall which formed its back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy breakers_ but high above the flying scud and dark_rolling clouds_ there floated a little isle of sunlight_ from which beamed forth an angel_s face_ and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the ship_s tossed deck_ something like that silver plate now inserted into the victory_s plank where nelson fell_ _ah_ noble ship__ the angel seemed to say_ _beat on_ beat on_ thou noble ship_ and bear a hardy helm_ for lo_ the sun is breaking through_ the clouds are rolling off_serenest azure is at hand__ nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea_taste that had achieved the ladder and the picture_ its panelled front was in the likeness of a ship_s bluff bows_ and the holy bible rested on a projecting piece of scroll work_ fashioned after a ship_s fiddle_headed beak_ what could be more full of meaning__for the pulpit is ever this earth_s foremost part_ all the rest comes in its rear_ the pulpit leads the world_ from thence it is the storm of god_s quick wrath is first descried_ and the bow must bear the earliest brunt_ from thence it is the god of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds_ yes_ the world_s a ship on its passage out_ and not a voyage complete_ and the pulpit is its prow_ chapter __ the sermon_ father mapple rose_ and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered the scattered people to condense_ _starboard gangway_ there_ side away to larboard_larboard gangway to starboard_ midships_ midships__ there was a low rumbling of heavy sea_boots among the benches_ and a still slighter shuffling of women_s shoes_ and all was quiet again_ and every eye on the preacher_ he paused a little_ then kneeling in the pulpit_s bows_ folded his large brown hands across his chest_ uplifted his closed eyes_ and offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom of the sea_ this ended_ in prolonged solemn tones_ like the continual tolling of a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog_in such tones he commenced reading the following hymn_ but changing his manner towards the concluding stanzas_ burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy_ _the ribs and terrors in the whale_ arched over me a dismal gloom_ while all god_s sun_lit waves rolled by_ and lift me deepening down to doom_ _i saw the opening maw of hell_ with endless pains and sorrows there_ which none but they that feel can tell_ oh_ i was plunging to despair_ _in black distress_ i called my god_ when i could scarce believe him mine_ he bowed his ear to my complaints_ no more the whale did me confine_ _with speed he flew to my relief_ as on a radiant dolphin borne_ awful_ yet bright_ as lightning shone the face of my deliverer god_ _my song for ever shall record that terrible_ that joyful hour_ i give the glory to my god_ his all the mercy and the power__ nearly all joined in singing this hymn_ which swelled high above the howling of the storm_ a brief pause ensued_ the preacher slowly turned over the leaves of the bible_ and at last_ folding his hand down upon the proper page_ said_ _beloved shipmates_ clinch the last verse of the first chapter of jonah__and god had prepared a great fish to swallow up jonah___ _shipmates_ this book_ containing only four chapters_four yarns_is one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the scriptures_ yet what depths of the soul does jonah_s deep sealine sound_ what a pregnant lesson to us is this prophet_ what a noble thing is that canticle in the fish_s belly_ how billow_like and boisterously grand_ we feel the floods surging over us_ we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters_ sea_weed and all the slime of the sea is about us_ but what is this lesson that the book of jonah teaches_ shipmates_ it is a two_stranded lesson_ a lesson to us all as sinful men_ and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living god_ as sinful men_ it is a lesson to us all_ because it is a story of the sin_ hard_heartedness_ suddenly awakened fears_ the swift punishment_ repentance_ prayers_ and finally the deliverance and joy of jonah_ as with all sinners among men_ the sin of this son of amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the command of god_never mind now what that command was_ or how conveyed_which he found a hard command_ but all the things that god would have us do are hard for us to do_remember that_and hence_ he oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade_ and if we obey god_ we must disobey ourselves_ and it is in this disobeying ourselves_ wherein the hardness of obeying god consists_ _with this sin of disobedience in him_ jonah still further flouts at god_ by seeking to flee from him_ he thinks that a ship made by men will carry him into countries where god does not reign_ but only the captains of this earth_ he skulks about the wharves of joppa_ and seeks a ship that_s bound for tarshish_ there lurks_ perhaps_ a hitherto unheeded meaning here_ by all accounts tarshish could have been no other city than the modern cadiz_ that_s the opinion of learned men_ and where is cadiz_ shipmates_ cadiz is in spain_ as far by water_ from joppa_ as jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days_ when the atlantic was an almost unknown sea_ because joppa_ the modern jaffa_ shipmates_ is on the most easterly coast of the mediterranean_ the syrian_ and tarshish or cadiz more than two thousand miles to the westward from that_ just outside the straits of gibraltar_ see ye not then_ shipmates_ that jonah sought to flee world_wide from god_ miserable man_ oh_ most contemptible and worthy of all scorn_ with slouched hat and guilty eye_ skulking from his god_ prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas_ so disordered_ self_condemning is his look_ that had there been policemen in those days_ jonah_ on the mere suspicion of something wrong_ had been arrested ere he touched a deck_ how plainly he_s a fugitive_ no baggage_ not a hat_box_ valise_ or carpet_bag__no friends accompany him to the wharf with their adieux_ at last_ after much dodging search_ he finds the tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo_ and as he steps on board to see its captain in the cabin_ all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the goods_ to mark the stranger_s evil eye_ jonah sees this_ but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence_ in vain essays his wretched smile_ strong intuitions of the man assure the mariners he can be no innocent_ in their gamesome but still serious way_ one whispers to the other__jack_ he_s robbed a widow__ or_ _joe_ do you mark him_ he_s a bigamist__ or_ _harry lad_ i guess he_s the adulterer that broke jail in old gomorrah_ or belike_ one of the missing murderers from sodom__ another runs to read the bill that_s stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is moored_ offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a parricide_ and containing a description of his person_ he reads_ and looks from jonah to the bill_ while all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round jonah_ prepared to lay their hands upon him_ frighted jonah trembles_ and summoning all his boldness to his face_ only looks so much the more a coward_ he will not confess himself suspected_ but that itself is strong suspicion_ so he makes the best of it_ and when the sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised_ they let him pass_ and he descends into the cabin_ __who_s there__ cries the captain at his busy desk_ hurriedly making out his papers for the customs__who_s there__ oh_ how that harmless question mangles jonah_ for the instant he almost turns to flee again_ but he rallies_ _i seek a passage in this ship to tarshish_ how soon sail ye_ sir__ thus far the busy captain had not looked up to jonah_ though the man now stands before him_ but no sooner does he hear that hollow voice_ than he darts a scrutinizing glance_ _we sail with the next coming tide__ at last he slowly answered_ still intently eyeing him_ _no sooner_ sir____soon enough for any honest man that goes a passenger__ ha_ jonah_ that_s another stab_ but he swiftly calls away the captain from that scent_ _i_ll sail with ye___he says___the passage money how much is that__i_ll pay now__ for it is particularly written_ shipmates_ as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history_ _that he paid the fare thereof_ ere the craft did sail_ and taken with the context_ this is full of meaning_ _now jonah_s captain_ shipmates_ was one whose discernment detects crime in any_ but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless_ in this world_ shipmates_ sin that pays its way can travel freely_ and without a passport_ whereas virtue_ if a pauper_ is stopped at all frontiers_ so jonah_s captain prepares to test the length of jonah_s purse_ ere he judge him openly_ he charges him thrice the usual sum_ and it_s assented to_ then the captain knows that jonah is a fugitive_ but at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold_ yet when jonah fairly takes out his purse_ prudent suspicions still molest the captain_ he rings every coin to find a counterfeit_ not a forger_ any way_ he mutters_ and jonah is put down for his passage_ _point out my state_room_ sir__ says jonah now_ _i_m travel_weary_ i need sleep__ _thou lookest like it__ says the captain_ _there_s thy room__ jonah enters_ and would lock the door_ but the lock contains no key_ hearing him foolishly fumbling there_ the captain laughs lowly to himself_ and mutters something about the doors of convicts_ cells being never allowed to be locked within_ all dressed and dusty as he is_ jonah throws himself into his berth_ and finds the little state_room ceiling almost resting on his forehead_ the air is close_ and jonah gasps_ then_ in that contracted hole_ sunk_ too_ beneath the ship_s water_line_ jonah feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour_ when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels_ wards_ _screwed at its axis against the side_ a swinging lamp slightly oscillates in jonah_s room_ and the ship_ heeling over towards the wharf with the weight of the last bales received_ the lamp_ flame and all_ though in slight motion_ still maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the room_ though_ in truth_ infallibly straight itself_ it but made obvious the false_ lying levels among which it hung_ the lamp alarms and frightens jonah_ as lying in his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place_ and this thus far successful fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance_ but that contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him_ the floor_ the ceiling_ and the side_ are all awry_ _oh_ so my conscience hangs in me__ he groans_ _straight upwards_ so it burns_ but the chambers of my soul are all in crookedness__ _like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed_ still reeling_ but with conscience yet pricking him_ as the plungings of the roman race_horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him_ as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish_ praying god for annihilation until the fit be passed_ and at last amid the whirl of woe he feels_ a deep stupor steals over him_ as over the man who bleeds to death_ for conscience is the wound_ and there_s naught to staunch it_ so_ after sore wrestlings in his berth_ jonah_s prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep_ _and now the time of tide has come_ the ship casts off her cables_ and from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for tarshish_ all careening_ glides to sea_ that ship_ my friends_ was the first of recorded smugglers_ the contraband was jonah_ but the sea rebels_ he will not bear the wicked burden_ a dreadful storm comes on_ the ship is like to break_ but now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her_ when boxes_ bales_ and jars are clattering overboard_ when the wind is shrieking_ and the men are yelling_ and every plank thunders with trampling feet right over jonah_s head_ in all this raging tumult_ jonah sleeps his hideous sleep_ he sees no black sky and raging sea_ feels not the reeling timbers_ and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale_ which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after him_ aye_ shipmates_ jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship_a berth in the cabin as i have taken it_ and was fast asleep_ but the frightened master comes to him_ and shrieks in his dead ear_ _what meanest thou_ o_ sleeper_ arise__ startled from his lethargy by that direful cry_ jonah staggers to his feet_ and stumbling to the deck_ grasps a shroud_ to look out upon the sea_ but at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks_ wave after wave thus leaps into the ship_ and finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft_ till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat_ and ever_ as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the steep gullies in the blackness overhead_ aghast jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing high upward_ but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep_ _terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul_ in all his cringing attitudes_ the god_fugitive is now too plainly known_ the sailors mark him_ more and more certain grow their suspicions of him_ and at last_ fully to test the truth_ by referring the whole matter to high heaven_ they fall to casting lots_ to see for whose cause this great tempest was upon them_ the lot is jonah_s_ that discovered_ then how furiously they mob him with their questions_ _what is thine occupation_ whence comest thou_ thy country_ what people_ but mark now_ my shipmates_ the behavior of poor jonah_ the eager mariners but ask him who he is_ and where from_ whereas_ they not only receive an answer to those questions_ but likewise another answer to a question not put by them_ but the unsolicited answer is forced from jonah by the hard hand of god that is upon him_ __i am a hebrew__ he cries_and then__i fear the lord the god of heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land__ fear him_ o jonah_ aye_ well mightest thou fear the lord god then_ straightway_ he now goes on to make a full confession_ whereupon the mariners became more and more appalled_ but still are pitiful_ for when jonah_ not yet supplicating god for mercy_ since he but too well knew the darkness of his deserts__when wretched jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him forth into the sea_ for he knew that for his sake this great tempest was upon them_ they mercifully turn from him_ and seek by other means to save the ship_ but all in vain_ the indignant gale howls louder_ then_ with one hand raised invokingly to god_ with the other they not unreluctantly lay hold of jonah_ _and now behold jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea_ when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east_ and the sea is still_ as jonah carries down the gale with him_ leaving smooth water behind_ he goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into the yawning jaws awaiting him_ and the whale shoots_to all his ivory teeth_ like so many white bolts_ upon his prison_ then jonah prayed unto the lord out of the fish_s belly_ but observe his prayer_ and learn a weighty lesson_ for sinful as he is_ jonah does not weep and wail for direct deliverance_ he feels that his dreadful punishment is just_ he leaves all his deliverance to god_ contenting himself with this_ that spite of all his pains and pangs_ he will still look towards his holy temple_ and here_ shipmates_ is true and faithful repentance_ not clamorous for pardon_ but grateful for punishment_ and how pleasing to god was this conduct in jonah_ is shown in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale_ shipmates_ i do not place jonah before you to be copied for his sin but i do place him before you as a model for repentance_ sin not_ but if you do_ take heed to repent of it like jonah__ while he was speaking these words_ the howling of the shrieking_ slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher_ who_ when describing jonah_s sea_storm_ seemed tossed by a storm himself_ his deep chest heaved as with a ground_swell_ his tossed arms seemed the warring elements at work_ and the thunders that rolled away from off his swarthy brow_ and the light leaping from his eye_ made all his simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them_ there now came a lull in his look_ as he silently turned over the leaves of the book once more_ and_ at last_ standing motionless_ with closed eyes_ for the moment_ seemed communing with god and himself_ but again he leaned over towards the people_ and bowing his head lowly_ with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility_ he spake these words_ _shipmates_ god has laid but one hand upon you_ both his hands press upon me_ i have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that jonah teaches to all sinners_ and therefore to ye_ and still more to me_ for i am a greater sinner than ye_ and now how gladly would i come down from this mast_head and sit on the hatches there where you sit_ and listen as you listen_ while some one of you reads me that other and more awful lesson which jonah teaches to me_ as a pilot of the living god_ how being an anointed pilot_prophet_ or speaker of true things_ and bidden by the lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked nineveh_ jonah_ appalled at the hostility he should raise_ fled from his mission_ and sought to escape his duty and his god by taking ship at joppa_ but god is everywhere_ tarshish he never reached_ as we have seen_ god came upon him in the whale_ and swallowed him down to living gulfs of doom_ and with swift slantings tore him along _into the midst of the seas__ where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down_ and _the weeds were wrapped about his head__ and all the watery world of woe bowled over him_ yet even then beyond the reach of any plummet__out of the belly of hell__when the whale grounded upon the ocean_s utmost bones_ even then_ god heard the engulphed_ repenting prophet when he cried_ then god spake unto the fish_ and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea_ the whale came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun_ and all the delights of air and earth_ and _vomited out jonah upon the dry land__ when the word of the lord came a second time_ and jonah_ bruised and beaten_his ears_ like two sea_shells_ still multitudinously murmuring of the ocean_jonah did the almighty_s bidding_ and what was that_ shipmates_ to preach the truth to the face of falsehood_ that was it_ _this_ shipmates_ this is that other lesson_ and woe to that pilot of the living god who slights it_ woe to him whom this world charms from gospel duty_ woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when god has brewed them into a gale_ woe to him who seeks to please rather than to appal_ woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness_ woe to him who_ in this world_ courts not dishonour_ woe to him who would not be true_ even though to be false were salvation_ yea_ woe to him who_ as the great pilot paul has it_ while preaching to others is himself a castaway__ he dropped and fell away from himself for a moment_ then lifting his face to them again_ showed a deep joy in his eyes_ as he cried out with a heavenly enthusiasm___but oh_ shipmates_ on the starboard hand of every woe_ there is a sure delight_ and higher the top of that delight_ than the bottom of the woe is deep_ is not the main_truck higher than the kelson is low_ delight is to him_a far_ far upward_ and inward delight_who against the proud gods and commodores of this earth_ ever stands forth his own inexorable self_ delight is to him whose strong arms yet support him_ when the ship of this base treacherous world has gone down beneath him_ delight is to him_ who gives no quarter in the truth_ and kills_ burns_ and destroys all sin though he pluck it out from under the robes of senators and judges_ delight__top_gallant delight is to him_ who acknowledges no law or lord_ but the lord his god_ and is only a patriot to heaven_ delight is to him_ whom all the waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this sure keel of the ages_ and eternal delight and deliciousness will be his_ who coming to lay him down_ can say with his final breath_o father__chiefly known to me by thy rod_mortal or immortal_ here i die_ i have striven to be thine_ more than to be this world_s_ or mine own_ yet this is nothing_ i leave eternity to thee_ for what is man that he should live out the lifetime of his god__ he said no more_ but slowly waving a benediction_ covered his face with his hands_ and so remained kneeling_ till all the people had departed_ and he was left alone in the place_ chapter ___ a bosom friend_ returning to the spouter_inn from the chapel_ i found queequeg there quite alone_ he having left the chapel before the benediction some time_ he was sitting on a bench before the fire_ with his feet on the stove hearth_ and in one hand was holding close up to his face that little negro idol of his_ peering hard into its face_ and with a jack_knife gently whittling away at its nose_ meanwhile humming to himself in his heathenish way_ but being now interrupted_ he put up the image_ and pretty soon_ going to the table_ took up a large book there_ and placing it on his lap began counting the pages with deliberate regularity_ at every fiftieth page_as i fancied_stopping a moment_ looking vacantly around him_ and giving utterance to a long_drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment_ he would then begin again at the next fifty_ seeming to commence at number one each time_ as though he could not count more than fifty_ and it was only by such a large number of fifties being found together_ that his astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited_ with much interest i sat watching him_ savage though he was_ and hideously marred about the face_at least to my taste_his countenance yet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable_ you cannot hide the soul_ through all his unearthly tattooings_ i thought i saw the traces of a simple honest heart_ and in his large_ deep eyes_ fiery black and bold_ there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand devils_ and besides all this_ there was a certain lofty bearing about the pagan_ which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim_ he looked like a man who had never cringed and never had had a creditor_ whether it was_ too_ that his head being shaved_ his forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief_ and looked more expansive than it otherwise would_ this i will not venture to decide_ but certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellent one_ it may seem ridiculous_ but it reminded me of general washington_s head_ as seen in the popular busts of him_ it had the same long regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows_ which were likewise very projecting_ like two long promontories thickly wooded on top_ queequeg was george washington cannibalistically developed_ whilst i was thus closely scanning him_ half_pretending meanwhile to be looking out at the storm from the casement_ he never heeded my presence_ never troubled himself with so much as a single glance_ but appeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous book_ considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night previous_ and especially considering the affectionate arm i had found thrown over me upon waking in the morning_ i thought this indifference of his very strange_ but savages are strange beings_ at times you do not know exactly how to take them_ at first they are overawing_ their calm self_collectedness of simplicity seems a socratic wisdom_ i had noticed also that queequeg never consorted at all_ or but very little_ with the other seamen in the inn_ he made no advances whatever_ appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances_ all this struck me as mighty singular_ yet_ upon second thoughts_ there was something almost sublime in it_ here was a man some twenty thousand miles from home_ by the way of cape horn_ that is_which was the only way he could get there_thrown among people as strange to him as though he were in the planet jupiter_ and yet he seemed entirely at his ease_ preserving the utmost serenity_ content with his own companionship_ always equal to himself_ surely this was a touch of fine philosophy_ though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that_ but_ perhaps_ to be true philosophers_ we mortals should not be conscious of so living or so striving_ so soon as i hear that such or such a man gives himself out for a philosopher_ i conclude that_ like the dyspeptic old woman_ he must have _broken his digester__ as i sat there in that now lonely room_ the fire burning low_ in that mild stage when_ after its first intensity has warmed the air_ it then only glows to be looked at_ the evening shades and phantoms gathering round the casements_ and peering in upon us silent_ solitary twain_ the storm booming without in solemn swells_ i began to be sensible of strange feelings_ i felt a melting in me_ no more my splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world_ this soothing savage had redeemed it_ there he sat_ his very indifference speaking a nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland deceits_ wild he was_ a very sight of sights to see_ yet i began to feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him_ and those same things that would have repelled most others_ they were the very magnets that thus drew me_ i_ll try a pagan friend_ thought i_ since christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy_ i drew my bench near him_ and made some friendly signs and hints_ doing my best to talk with him meanwhile_ at first he little noticed these advances_ but presently_ upon my referring to his last night_s hospitalities_ he made out to ask me whether we were again to be bedfellows_ i told him yes_ whereat i thought he looked pleased_ perhaps a little complimented_ we then turned over the book together_ and i endeavored to explain to him the purpose of the printing_ and the meaning of the few pictures that were in it_ thus i soon engaged his interest_ and from that we went to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen in this famous town_ soon i proposed a social smoke_ and_ producing his pouch and tomahawk_ he quietly offered me a puff_ and then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his_ and keeping it regularly passing between us_ if there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the pagan_s breast_ this pleasant_ genial smoke we had_ soon thawed it out_ and left us cronies_ he seemed to take to me quite as naturally and unbiddenly as i to him_ and when our smoke was over_ he pressed his forehead against mine_ clasped me round the waist_ and said that henceforth we were married_ meaning_ in his country_s phrase_ that we were bosom friends_ he would gladly die for me_ if need should be_ in a countryman_ this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too premature_ a thing to be much distrusted_ but in this simple savage those old rules would not apply_ after supper_ and another social chat and smoke_ we went to our room together_ he made me a present of his embalmed head_ took out his enormous tobacco wallet_ and groping under the tobacco_ drew out some thirty dollars in silver_ then spreading them on the table_ and mechanically dividing them into two equal portions_ pushed one of them towards me_ and said it was mine_ i was going to remonstrate_ but he silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers_ pockets_ i let them stay_ he then went about his evening prayers_ took out his idol_ and removed the paper fireboard_ by certain signs and symptoms_ i thought he seemed anxious for me to join him_ but well knowing what was to follow_ i deliberated a moment whether_ in case he invited me_ i would comply or otherwise_ i was a good christian_ born and bred in the bosom of the infallible presbyterian church_ how then could i unite with this wild idolator in worshipping his piece of wood_ but what is worship_ thought i_ do you suppose now_ ishmael_ that the magnanimous god of heaven and earth_pagans and all included_can possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood_ impossible_ but what is worship__to do the will of god_that is worship_ and what is the will of god__to do to my fellow man what i would have my fellow man to do to me_that is the will of god_ now_ queequeg is my fellow man_ and what do i wish that this queequeg would do to me_ why_ unite with me in my particular presbyterian form of worship_ consequently_ i must then unite with him in his_ ergo_ i must turn idolator_ so i kindled the shavings_ helped prop up the innocent little idol_ offered him burnt biscuit with queequeg_ salamed before him twice or thrice_ kissed his nose_ and that done_ we undressed and went to bed_ at peace with our own consciences and all the world_ but we did not go to sleep without some little chat_ how it is i know not_ but there is no place like a bed for confidential disclosures between friends_ man and wife_ they say_ there open the very bottom of their souls to each other_ and some old couples often lie and chat over old times till nearly morning_ thus_ then_ in our hearts_ honeymoon_ lay i and queequeg_a cosy_ loving pair_ chapter ___ nightgown_ we had lain thus in bed_ chatting and napping at short intervals_ and queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs over mine_ and then drawing them back_ so entirely sociable and free and easy were we_ when_ at last_ by reason of our confabulations_ what little nappishness remained in us altogether departed_ and we felt like getting up again_ though day_break was yet some way down the future_ yes_ we became very wakeful_ so much so that our recumbent position began to grow wearisome_ and by little and little we found ourselves sitting up_ the clothes well tucked around us_ leaning against the head_board with our four knees drawn up close together_ and our two noses bending over them_ as if our kneepans were warming_pans_ we felt very nice and snug_ the more so since it was so chilly out of doors_ indeed out of bed_clothes too_ seeing that there was no fire in the room_ the more so_ i say_ because truly to enjoy bodily warmth_ some small part of you must be cold_ for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast_ nothing exists in itself_ if you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable_ and have been so a long time_ then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more_ but if_ like queequeg and me in the bed_ the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled_ why then_ indeed_ in the general consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm_ for this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire_ which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich_ for the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air_ then there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal_ we had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time_ when all at once i thought i would open my eyes_ for when between sheets_ whether by day or by night_ and whether asleep or awake_ i have a way of always keeping my eyes shut_ in order the more to concentrate the snugness of being in bed_ because no man can ever feel his own identity aright except his eyes be closed_ as if darkness were indeed the proper element of our essences_ though light be more congenial to our clayey part_ upon opening my eyes then_ and coming out of my own pleasant and self_created darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated twelve_o_clock_at_night_ i experienced a disagreeable revulsion_ nor did i at all object to the hint from queequeg that perhaps it were best to strike a light_ seeing that we were so wide awake_ and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his tomahawk_ be it said_ that though i had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before_ yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them_ for now i liked nothing better than to have queequeg smoking by me_ even in bed_ because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy then_ i no more felt unduly concerned for the landlord_s policy of insurance_ i was only alive to the condensed confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend_ with our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders_ we now passed the tomahawk from one to the other_ till slowly there grew over us a blue hanging tester of smoke_ illuminated by the flame of the new_lit lamp_ whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far distant scenes_ i know not_ but he now spoke of his native island_ and_ eager to hear his history_ i begged him to go on and tell it_ he gladly complied_ though at the time i but ill comprehended not a few of his words_ yet subsequent disclosures_ when i had become more familiar with his broken phraseology_ now enable me to present the whole story such as it may prove in the mere skeleton i give_ chapter ___ biographical_ queequeg was a native of rokovoko_ an island far away to the west and south_ it is not down in any map_ true places never are_ when a new_hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a grass clout_ followed by the nibbling goats_ as if he were a green sapling_ even then_ in queequeg_s ambitious soul_ lurked a strong desire to see something more of christendom than a specimen whaler or two_ his father was a high chief_ a king_ his uncle a high priest_ and on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of unconquerable warriors_ there was excellent blood in his veins_royal stuff_ though sadly vitiated_ i fear_ by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his untutored youth_ a sag harbor ship visited his father_s bay_ and queequeg sought a passage to christian lands_ but the ship_ having her full complement of seamen_ spurned his suit_ and not all the king his father_s influence could prevail_ but queequeg vowed a vow_ alone in his canoe_ he paddled off to a distant strait_ which he knew the ship must pass through when she quitted the island_ on one side was a coral reef_ on the other a low tongue of land_ covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the water_ hiding his canoe_ still afloat_ among these thickets_ with its prow seaward_ he sat down in the stern_ paddle low in hand_ and when the ship was gliding by_ like a flash he darted out_ gained her side_ with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe_ climbed up the chains_ and throwing himself at full length upon the deck_ grappled a ring_bolt there_ and swore not to let it go_ though hacked in pieces_ in vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard_ suspended a cutlass over his naked wrists_ queequeg was the son of a king_ and queequeg budged not_ struck by his desperate dauntlessness_ and his wild desire to visit christendom_ the captain at last relented_ and told him he might make himself at home_ but this fine young savage_this sea prince of wales_ never saw the captain_s cabin_ they put him down among the sailors_ and made a whaleman of him_ but like czar peter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities_ queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy_ if thereby he might happily gain the power of enlightening his untutored countrymen_ for at bottom_so he told me_he was actuated by a profound desire to learn among the christians_ the arts whereby to make his people still happier than they were_ and more than that_ still better than they were_ but_ alas_ the practices of whalemen soon convinced him that even christians could be both miserable and wicked_ infinitely more so_ than all his father_s heathens_ arrived at last in old sag harbor_ and seeing what the sailors did there_ and then going on to nantucket_ and seeing how they spent their wages in that place also_ poor queequeg gave it up for lost_ thought he_ it_s a wicked world in all meridians_ i_ll die a pagan_ and thus an old idolator at heart_ he yet lived among these christians_ wore their clothes_ and tried to talk their gibberish_ hence the queer ways about him_ though now some time from home_ by hints_ i asked him whether he did not propose going back_ and having a coronation_ since he might now consider his father dead and gone_ he being very old and feeble at the last accounts_ he answered no_ not yet_ and added that he was fearful christianity_ or rather christians_ had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan kings before him_ but by and by_ he said_ he would return__as soon as he felt himself baptized again_ for the nonce_ however_ he proposed to sail about_ and sow his wild oats in all four oceans_ they had made a harpooneer of him_ and that barbed iron was in lieu of a sceptre now_ i asked him what might be his immediate purpose_ touching his future movements_ he answered_ to go to sea again_ in his old vocation_ upon this_ i told him that whaling was my own design_ and informed him of my intention to sail out of nantucket_ as being the most promising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark from_ he at once resolved to accompany me to that island_ ship aboard the same vessel_ get into the same watch_ the same boat_ the same mess with me_ in short to share my every hap_ with both my hands in his_ boldly dip into the potluck of both worlds_ to all this i joyously assented_ for besides the affection i now felt for queequeg_ he was an experienced harpooneer_ and as such_ could not fail to be of great usefulness to one_ who_ like me_ was wholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling_ though well acquainted with the sea_ as known to merchant seamen_ his story being ended with his pipe_s last dying puff_ queequeg embraced me_ pressed his forehead against mine_ and blowing out the light_ we rolled over from each other_ this way and that_ and very soon were sleeping_ chapter ___ wheelbarrow_ next morning_ monday_ after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber_ for a block_ i settled my own and comrade_s bill_ using_ however_ my comrade_s money_ the grinning landlord_ as well as the boarders_ seemed amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between me and queequeg_especially as peter coffin_s cock and bull stories about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person whom i now companied with_ we borrowed a wheelbarrow_ and embarking our things_ including my own poor carpet_bag_ and queequeg_s canvas sack and hammock_ away we went down to _the moss__ the little nantucket packet schooner moored at the wharf_ as we were going along the people stared_ not at queequeg so much_for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their streets__but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms_ but we heeded them not_ going along wheeling the barrow by turns_ and queequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs_ i asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore_ and whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons_ to this_ in substance_ he replied_ that though what i hinted was true enough_ yet he had a particular affection for his own harpoon_ because it was of assured stuff_ well tried in many a mortal combat_ and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales_ in short_ like many inland reapers and mowers_ who go into the farmers_ meadows armed with their own scythes_though in no wise obliged to furnish them_even so_ queequeg_ for his own private reasons_ preferred his own harpoon_ shifting the barrow from my hand to his_ he told me a funny story about the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen_ it was in sag harbor_ the owners of his ship_ it seems_ had lent him one_ in which to carry his heavy chest to his boarding house_ not to seem ignorant about the thing_though in truth he was entirely so_ concerning the precise way in which to manage the barrow_queequeg puts his chest upon it_ lashes it fast_ and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf_ _why__ said i_ _queequeg_ you might have known better than that_ one would think_ didn_t the people laugh__ upon this_ he told me another story_ the people of his island of rokovoko_ it seems_ at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl_ and this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided mat where the feast is held_ now a certain grand merchant ship once touched at rokovoko_ and its commander_from all accounts_ a very stately punctilious gentleman_ at least for a sea captain_this commander was invited to the wedding feast of queequeg_s sister_ a pretty young princess just turned of ten_ well_ when all the wedding guests were assembled at the bride_s bamboo cottage_ this captain marches in_ and being assigned the post of honour_ placed himself over against the punchbowl_ and between the high priest and his majesty the king_ queequeg_s father_ grace being said__for those people have their grace as well as we_though queequeg told me that unlike us_ who at such times look downwards to our platters_ they_ on the contrary_ copying the ducks_ glance upwards to the great giver of all feasts_grace_ i say_ being said_ the high priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the island_ that is_ dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates_ seeing himself placed next the priest_ and noting the ceremony_ and thinking himself_being captain of a ship_as having plain precedence over a mere island king_ especially in the king_s own house_the captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the punchbowl__taking it i suppose for a huge finger_glass_ _now__ said queequeg_ _what you tink now__didn_t our people laugh__ at last_ passage paid_ and luggage safe_ we stood on board the schooner_ hoisting sail_ it glided down the acushnet river_ on one side_ new bedford rose in terraces of streets_ their ice_covered trees all glittering in the clear_ cold air_ huge hills and mountains of casks on casks were piled upon her wharves_ and side by side the world_wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last_ while from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers_ with blended noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch_ all betokening that new cruises were on the start_ that one most perilous and long voyage ended_ only begins a second_ and a second ended_ only begins a third_ and so on_ for ever and for aye_ such is the endlessness_ yea_ the intolerableness of all earthly effort_ gaining the more open water_ the bracing breeze waxed fresh_ the little moss tossed the quick foam from her bows_ as a young colt his snortings_ how i snuffed that tartar air__how i spurned that turnpike earth__that common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish heels and hoofs_ and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will permit no records_ at the same foam_fountain_ queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me_ his dusky nostrils swelled apart_ he showed his filed and pointed teeth_ on_ on we flew_ and our offing gained_ the moss did homage to the blast_ ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the sultan_ sideways leaning_ we sideways darted_ every ropeyarn tingling like a wire_ the two tall masts buckling like indian canes in land tornadoes_ so full of this reeling scene were we_ as we stood by the plunging bowsprit_ that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers_ a lubber_like assembly_ who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so companionable_ as though a white man were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro_ but there were some boobies and bumpkins there_ who_ by their intense greenness_ must have come from the heart and centre of all verdure_ queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind his back_ i thought the bumpkin_s hour of doom was come_ dropping his harpoon_ the brawny savage caught him in his arms_ and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength_ sent him high up bodily into the air_ then slightly tapping his stern in mid_somerset_ the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet_ while queequeg_ turning his back upon him_ lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff_ _capting_ capting__ yelled the bumpkin_ running towards that officer_ _capting_ capting_ here_s the devil__ _hallo_ you sir__ cried the captain_ a gaunt rib of the sea_ stalking up to queequeg_ _what in thunder do you mean by that_ don_t you know you might have killed that chap__ _what him say__ said queequeg_ as he mildly turned to me_ _he say__ said i_ _that you came near kill_e that man there__ pointing to the still shivering greenhorn_ _kill_e__ cried queequeg_ twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly expression of disdain_ _ah_ him bevy small_e fish_e_ queequeg no kill_e so small_e fish_e_ queequeg kill_e big whale__ _look you__ roared the captain_ _i_ll kill_e you_ you cannibal_ if you try any more of your tricks aboard here_ so mind your eye__ but it so happened just then_ that it was high time for the captain to mind his own eye_ the prodigious strain upon the main_sail had parted the weather_sheet_ and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to side_ completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck_ the poor fellow whom queequeg had handled so roughly_ was swept overboard_ all hands were in a panic_ and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it_ seemed madness_ it flew from right to left_ and back again_ almost in one ticking of a watch_ and every instant seemed on the point of snapping into splinters_ nothing was done_ and nothing seemed capable of being done_ those on deck rushed towards the bows_ and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale_ in the midst of this consternation_ queequeg dropped deftly to his knees_ and crawling under the path of the boom_ whipped hold of a rope_ secured one end to the bulwarks_ and then flinging the other like a lasso_ caught it round the boom as it swept over his head_ and at the next jerk_ the spar was that way trapped_ and all was safe_ the schooner was run into the wind_ and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat_ queequeg_ stripped to the waist_ darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap_ for three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog_ throwing his long arms straight out before him_ and by turns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam_ i looked at the grand and glorious fellow_ but saw no one to be saved_ the greenhorn had gone down_ shooting himself perpendicularly from the water_ queequeg_ now took an instant_s glance around him_ and seeming to see just how matters were_ dived down and disappeared_ a few minutes more_ and he rose again_ one arm still striking out_ and with the other dragging a lifeless form_ the boat soon picked them up_ the poor bumpkin was restored_ all hands voted queequeg a noble trump_ the captain begged his pardon_ from that hour i clove to queequeg like a barnacle_ yea_ till poor queequeg took his last long dive_ was there ever such unconsciousness_ he did not seem to think that he at all deserved a medal from the humane and magnanimous societies_ he only asked for water_fresh water_something to wipe the brine off_ that done_ he put on dry clothes_ lighted his pipe_ and leaning against the bulwarks_ and mildly eyeing those around him_ seemed to be saying to himself__it_s a mutual_ joint_stock world_ in all meridians_ we cannibals must help these christians__ chapter ___ nantucket_ nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning_ so_ after a fine run_ we safely arrived in nantucket_ nantucket_ take out your map and look at it_ see what a real corner of the world it occupies_ how it stands there_ away off shore_ more lonely than the eddystone lighthouse_ look at it_a mere hillock_ and elbow of sand_ all beach_ without a background_ there is more sand there than you would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper_ some gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there_ they don_t grow naturally_ that they import canada thistles_ that they have to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask_ that pieces of wood in nantucket are carried about like bits of the true cross in rome_ that people there plant toadstools before their houses_ to get under the shade in summer time_ that one blade of grass makes an oasis_ three blades in a day_s walk a prairie_ that they wear quicksand shoes_ something like laplander snow_shoes_ that they are so shut up_ belted about_ every way inclosed_ surrounded_ and made an utter island of by the ocean_ that to their very chairs and tables small clams will sometimes be found adhering_ as to the backs of sea turtles_ but these extravaganzas only show that nantucket is no illinois_ look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was settled by the red_men_ thus goes the legend_ in olden times an eagle swooped down upon the new england coast_ and carried off an infant indian in his talons_ with loud lament the parents saw their child borne out of sight over the wide waters_ they resolved to follow in the same direction_ setting out in their canoes_ after a perilous passage they discovered the island_ and there they found an empty ivory casket__the poor little indian_s skeleton_ what wonder_ then_ that these nantucketers_ born on a beach_ should take to the sea for a livelihood_ they first caught crabs and quohogs in the sand_ grown bolder_ they waded out with nets for mackerel_ more experienced_ they pushed off in boats and captured cod_ and at last_ launching a navy of great ships on the sea_ explored this watery world_ put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it_ peeped in at behring_s straits_ and in all seasons and all oceans declared everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the flood_ most monstrous and most mountainous_ that himmalehan_ salt_sea mastodon_ clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power_ that his very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious assaults_ and thus have these naked nantucketers_ these sea hermits_ issuing from their ant_hill in the sea_ overrun and conquered the watery world like so many alexanders_ parcelling out among them the atlantic_ pacific_ and indian oceans_ as the three pirate powers did poland_ let america add mexico to texas_ and pile cuba upon canada_ let the english overswarm all india_ and hang out their blazing banner from the sun_ two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the nantucketer_s_ for the sea is his_ he owns it_ as emperors own empires_ other seamen having but a right of way through it_ merchant ships are but extension bridges_ armed ones but floating forts_ even pirates and privateers_ though following the sea as highwaymen the road_ they but plunder other ships_ other fragments of the land like themselves_ without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless deep itself_ the nantucketer_ he alone resides and riots on the sea_ he alone_ in bible language_ goes down to it in ships_ to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation_ there is his home_ there lies his business_ which a noah_s flood would not interrupt_ though it overwhelmed all the millions in china_ he lives on the sea_ as prairie cocks in the prairie_ he hides among the waves_ he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the alps_ for years he knows not the land_ so that when he comes to it at last_ it smells like another world_ more strangely than the moon would to an earthsman_ with the landless gull_ that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows_ so at nightfall_ the nantucketer_ out of sight of land_ furls his sails_ and lays him to his rest_ while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales_ chapter ___ chowder_ it was quite late in the evening when the little moss came snugly to anchor_ and queequeg and i went ashore_ so we could attend to no business that day_ at least none but a supper and a bed_ the landlord of the spouter_inn had recommended us to his cousin hosea hussey of the try pots_ whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in all nantucket_ and moreover he had assured us that cousin hosea_ as he called him_ was famous for his chowders_ in short_ he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot_luck at the try pots_ but the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard_ and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard_ and that done_ then ask the first man we met where the place was_ these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first_ especially as_ at the outset_ queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse_our first point of departure_must be left on the larboard hand_ whereas i had understood peter coffin to say it was on the starboard_ however_ by dint of beating about a little in the dark_ and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way_ we at last came to something which there was no mistaking_ two enormous wooden pots painted black_ and suspended by asses_ ears_ swung from the cross_trees of an old top_mast_ planted in front of an old doorway_ the horns of the cross_trees were sawed off on the other side_ so that this old top_mast looked not a little like a gallows_ perhaps i was over sensitive to such impressions at the time_ but i could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving_ a sort of crick was in my neck as i gazed up to the two remaining horns_ yes_ two of them_ one for queequeg_ and one for me_ it_s ominous_ thinks i_ a coffin my innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port_ tombstones staring at me in the whalemen_s chapel_ and here a gallows_ and a pair of prodigious black pots too_ are these last throwing out oblique hints touching tophet_ i was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown_ standing in the porch of the inn_ under a dull red lamp swinging there_ that looked much like an injured eye_ and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt_ _get along with ye__ said she to the man_ _or i_ll be combing ye__ _come on_ queequeg__ said i_ _all right_ there_s mrs_ hussey__ and so it turned out_ mr_ hosea hussey being from home_ but leaving mrs_ hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs_ upon making known our desires for a supper and a bed_ mrs_ hussey_ postponing further scolding for the present_ ushered us into a little room_ and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded repast_ turned round to us and said__clam or cod__ _what_s that about cods_ ma_am__ said i_ with much politeness_ _clam or cod__ she repeated_ _a clam for supper_ a cold clam_ is that what you mean_ mrs_ hussey__ says i_ _but that_s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter time_ ain_t it_ mrs_ hussey__ but being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple shirt_ who was waiting for it in the entry_ and seeming to hear nothing but the word _clam__ mrs_ hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the kitchen_ and bawling out _clam for two__ disappeared_ _queequeg__ said i_ _do you think that we can make out a supper for us both on one clam__ however_ a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the apparently cheerless prospect before us_ but when that smoking chowder came in_ the mystery was delightfully explained_ oh_ sweet friends_ hearken to me_ it was made of small juicy clams_ scarcely bigger than hazel nuts_ mixed with pounded ship biscuit_ and salted pork cut up into little flakes_ the whole enriched with butter_ and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt_ our appetites being sharpened by the frosty voyage_ and in particular_ queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food before him_ and the chowder being surpassingly excellent_ we despatched it with great expedition_ when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of mrs_ hussey_s clam and cod announcement_ i thought i would try a little experiment_ stepping to the kitchen door_ i uttered the word _cod_ with great emphasis_ and resumed my seat_ in a few moments the savoury steam came forth again_ but with a different flavor_ and in good time a fine cod_chowder was placed before us_ we resumed business_ and while plying our spoons in the bowl_ thinks i to myself_ i wonder now if this here has any effect on the head_ what_s that stultifying saying about chowder_headed people_ _but look_ queequeg_ ain_t that a live eel in your bowl_ where_s your harpoon__ fishiest of all fishy places was the try pots_ which well deserved its name_ for the pots there were always boiling chowders_ chowder for breakfast_ and chowder for dinner_ and chowder for supper_ till you began to look for fish_bones coming through your clothes_ the area before the house was paved with clam_shells_ mrs_ hussey wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebra_ and hosea hussey had his account books bound in superior old shark_skin_ there was a fishy flavor to the milk_ too_ which i could not at all account for_ till one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen_s boats_ i saw hosea_s brindled cow feeding on fish remnants_ and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod_s decapitated head_ looking very slip_shod_ i assure ye_ supper concluded_ we received a lamp_ and directions from mrs_ hussey concerning the nearest way to bed_ but_ as queequeg was about to precede me up the stairs_ the lady reached forth her arm_ and demanded his harpoon_ she allowed no harpoon in her chambers_ _why not__ said i_ _every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon_but why not__ _because it_s dangerous__ says she_ _ever since young stiggs coming from that unfort_nt v_y_ge of his_ when he was gone four years and a half_ with only three barrels of ile_ was found dead in my first floor back_ with his harpoon in his side_ ever since then i allow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night_ so_ mr_ queequeg_ _for she had learned his name__ _i will just take this here iron_ and keep it for you till morning_ but the chowder_ clam or cod to_morrow for breakfast_ men__ _both__ says i_ _and let_s have a couple of smoked herring by way of variety__ chapter ___ the ship_ in bed we concocted our plans for the morrow_ but to my surprise and no small concern_ queequeg now gave me to understand_ that he had been diligently consulting yojo_the name of his black little god_and yojo had told him two or three times over_ and strongly insisted upon it everyway_ that instead of our going together among the whaling_fleet in harbor_ and in concert selecting our craft_ instead of this_ i say_ yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly with me_ inasmuch as yojo purposed befriending us_ and_ in order to do so_ had already pitched upon a vessel_ which_ if left to myself_ i_ ishmael_ should infallibly light upon_ for all the world as though it had turned out by chance_ and in that vessel i must immediately ship myself_ for the present irrespective of queequeg_ i have forgotten to mention that_ in many things_ queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of yojo_s judgment and surprising forecast of things_ and cherished yojo with considerable esteem_ as a rather good sort of god_ who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole_ but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs_ now_ this plan of queequeg_s_ or rather yojo_s_ touching the selection of our craft_ i did not like that plan at all_ i had not a little relied upon queequeg_s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely_ but as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon queequeg_ i was obliged to acquiesce_ and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor_ that should quickly settle that trifling little affair_ next morning early_ leaving queequeg shut up with yojo in our little bedroom_for it seemed that it was some sort of lent or ramadan_ or day of fasting_ humiliation_ and prayer with queequeg and yojo that day_ how it was i never could find out_ for_ though i applied myself to it several times_ i never could master his liturgies and xxxix articles_leaving queequeg_ then_ fasting on his tomahawk pipe_ and yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings_ i sallied out among the shipping_ after much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries_ i learnt that there were three ships up for three_years_ voyages_the devil_dam_ the tit_bit_ and the pequod_ devil_dam_ i do not know the origin of_ tit_bit is obvious_ pequod_ you will no doubt remember_ was the name of a celebrated tribe of massachusetts indians_ now extinct as the ancient medes_ i peered and pryed about the devil_dam_ from her_ hopped over to the tit_bit_ and finally_ going on board the pequod_ looked around her for a moment_ and then decided that this was the very ship for us_ you may have seen many a quaint craft in your day_ for aught i know__square_toed luggers_ mountainous japanese junks_ butter_box galliots_ and what not_ but take my word for it_ you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old pequod_ she was a ship of the old school_ rather small if anything_ with an old_fashioned claw_footed look about her_ long seasoned and weather_stained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans_ her old hull_s complexion was darkened like a french grenadier_s_ who has alike fought in egypt and siberia_ her venerable bows looked bearded_ her masts_cut somewhere on the coast of japan_ where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale_her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of cologne_ her ancient decks were worn and wrinkled_ like the pilgrim_worshipped flag_stone in canterbury cathedral where becket bled_ but to all these her old antiquities_ were added new and marvellous features_ pertaining to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed_ old captain peleg_ many years her chief_mate_ before he commanded another vessel of his own_ and now a retired seaman_ and one of the principal owners of the pequod__this old peleg_ during the term of his chief_mateship_ had built upon her original grotesqueness_ and inlaid it_ all over_ with a quaintness both of material and device_ unmatched by anything except it be thorkill_hake_s carved buckler or bedstead_ she was apparelled like any barbaric ethiopian emperor_ his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory_ she was a thing of trophies_ a cannibal of a craft_ tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies_ all round_ her unpanelled_ open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw_ with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale_ inserted there for pins_ to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to_ those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood_ but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea_ivory_ scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm_ she sported there a tiller_ and that tiller was in one mass_ curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe_ the helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest_ felt like the tartar_ when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw_ a noble craft_ but somehow a most melancholy_ all noble things are touched with that_ now when i looked about the quarter_deck_ for some one having authority_ in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage_ at first i saw nobody_ but i could not well overlook a strange sort of tent_ or rather wigwam_ pitched a little behind the main_mast_ it seemed only a temporary erection used in port_ it was of a conical shape_ some ten feet high_ consisting of the long_ huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the right_whale_ planted with their broad ends on the deck_ a circle of these slabs laced together_ mutually sloped towards each other_ and at the apex united in a tufted point_ where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top_knot on some old pottowottamie sachem_s head_ a triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship_ so that the insider commanded a complete view forward_ and half concealed in this queer tenement_ i at length found one who by his aspect seemed to have authority_ and who_ it being noon_ and the ship_s work suspended_ was now enjoying respite from the burden of command_ he was seated on an old_fashioned oaken chair_ wriggling all over with curious carving_ and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed_ there was nothing so very particular_ perhaps_ about the appearance of the elderly man i saw_ he was brown and brawny_ like most old seamen_ and heavily rolled up in blue pilot_cloth_ cut in the quaker style_ only there was a fine and almost microscopic net_work of the minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes_ which must have arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales_ and always looking to windward__for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together_ such eye_wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl_ _is this the captain of the pequod__ said i_ advancing to the door of the tent_ _supposing it be the captain of the pequod_ what dost thou want of him__ he demanded_ _i was thinking of shipping__ _thou wast_ wast thou_ i see thou art no nantucketer_ever been in a stove boat__ _no_ sir_ i never have__ _dost know nothing at all about whaling_ i dare say_eh_ _nothing_ sir_ but i have no doubt i shall soon learn_ i_ve been several voyages in the merchant service_ and i think that__ _merchant service be damned_ talk not that lingo to me_ dost see that leg__i_ll take that leg away from thy stern_ if ever thou talkest of the marchant service to me again_ marchant service indeed_ i suppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships_ but flukes_ man_ what makes thee want to go a whaling_ eh__it looks a little suspicious_ don_t it_ eh__hast not been a pirate_ hast thou__didst not rob thy last captain_ didst thou__dost not think of murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea__ i protested my innocence of these things_ i saw that under the mask of these half humorous innuendoes_ this old seaman_ as an insulated quakerish nantucketer_ was full of his insular prejudices_ and rather distrustful of all aliens_ unless they hailed from cape cod or the vineyard_ _but what takes thee a_whaling_ i want to know that before i think of shipping ye__ _well_ sir_ i want to see what whaling is_ i want to see the world__ _want to see what whaling is_ eh_ have ye clapped eye on captain ahab__ _who is captain ahab_ sir__ _aye_ aye_ i thought so_ captain ahab is the captain of this ship__ _i am mistaken then_ i thought i was speaking to the captain himself__ _thou art speaking to captain peleg_that_s who ye are speaking to_ young man_ it belongs to me and captain bildad to see the pequod fitted out for the voyage_ and supplied with all her needs_ including crew_ we are part owners and agents_ but as i was going to say_ if thou wantest to know what whaling is_ as thou tellest ye do_ i can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it_ past backing out_ clap eye on captain ahab_ young man_ and thou wilt find that he has only one leg__ _what do you mean_ sir_ was the other one lost by a whale__ _lost by a whale_ young man_ come nearer to me_ it was devoured_ chewed up_ crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a boat__ah_ ah__ i was a little alarmed by his energy_ perhaps also a little touched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation_ but said as calmly as i could_ _what you say is no doubt true enough_ sir_ but how could i know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale_ though indeed i might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident__ _look ye now_ young man_ thy lungs are a sort of soft_ d_ye see_ thou dost not talk shark a bit_ sure_ ye_ve been to sea before now_ sure of that__ _sir__ said i_ _i thought i told you that i had been four voyages in the merchant__ _hard down out of that_ mind what i said about the marchant service_don_t aggravate me_i won_t have it_ but let us understand each other_ i have given thee a hint about what whaling is_ do ye yet feel inclined for it__ _i do_ sir__ _very good_ now_ art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale_s throat_ and then jump after it_ answer_ quick__ _i am_ sir_ if it should be positively indispensable to do so_ not to be got rid of_ that is_ which i don_t take to be the fact__ _good again_ now then_ thou not only wantest to go a_whaling_ to find out by experience what whaling is_ but ye also want to go in order to see the world_ was not that what ye said_ i thought so_ well then_ just step forward there_ and take a peep over the weather_bow_ and then back to me and tell me what ye see there__ for a moment i stood a little puzzled by this curious request_ not knowing exactly how to take it_ whether humorously or in earnest_ but concentrating all his crow_s feet into one scowl_ captain peleg started me on the errand_ going forward and glancing over the weather bow_ i perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the flood_tide_ was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean_ the prospect was unlimited_ but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding_ not the slightest variety that i could see_ _well_ what_s the report__ said peleg when i came back_ _what did ye see__ _not much__ i replied__nothing but water_ considerable horizon though_ and there_s a squall coming up_ i think__ _well_ what does thou think then of seeing the world_ do ye wish to go round cape horn to see any more of it_ eh_ can_t ye see the world where you stand__ i was a little staggered_ but go a_whaling i must_ and i would_ and the pequod was as good a ship as any_i thought the best_and all this i now repeated to peleg_ seeing me so determined_ he expressed his willingness to ship me_ _and thou mayest as well sign the papers right off__ he added__come along with ye__ and so saying_ he led the way below deck into the cabin_ seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising figure_ it turned out to be captain bildad_ who along with captain peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel_ the other shares_ as is sometimes the case in these ports_ being held by a crowd of old annuitants_ widows_ fatherless children_ and chancery wards_ each owning about the value of a timber head_ or a foot of plank_ or a nail or two in the ship_ people in nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels_ the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing in good interest_ now_ bildad_ like peleg_ and indeed many other nantucketers_ was a quaker_ the island having been originally settled by that sect_ and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the quaker_ only variously and anomalously modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous_ for some of these same quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale_hunters_ they are fighting quakers_ they are quakers with a vengeance_ so that there are instances among them of men_ who_ named with scripture names_a singularly common fashion on the island_and in childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the quaker idiom_ still_ from the audacious_ daring_ and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives_ strangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities_ a thousand bold dashes of character_ not unworthy a scandinavian sea_king_ or a poetical pagan roman_ and when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force_ with a globular brain and a ponderous heart_ who has also by the stillness and seclusion of many long night_watches in the remotest waters_ and beneath constellations never seen here at the north_ been led to think untraditionally and independently_ receiving all nature_s sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding breast_ and thereby chiefly_ but with some help from accidental advantages_ to learn a bold and nervous lofty language_that man makes one in a whole nation_s census_a mighty pageant creature_ formed for noble tragedies_ nor will it at all detract from him_ dramatically regarded_ if either by birth or other circumstances_ he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature_ for all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness_ be sure of this_ o young ambition_ all mortal greatness is but disease_ but_ as yet we have not to do with such an one_ but with quite another_ and still a man_ who_ if indeed peculiar_ it only results again from another phase of the quaker_ modified by individual circumstances_ like captain peleg_ captain bildad was a well_to_do_ retired whaleman_ but unlike captain peleg_who cared not a rush for what are called serious things_ and indeed deemed those self_same serious things the veriest of all trifles_captain bildad had not only been originally educated according to the strictest sect of nantucket quakerism_ but all his subsequent ocean life_ and the sight of many unclad_ lovely island creatures_ round the horn_all that had not moved this native born quaker one single jot_ had not so much as altered one angle of his vest_ still_ for all this immutableness_ was there some lack of common consistency about worthy captain bildad_ though refusing_ from conscientious scruples_ to bear arms against land invaders_ yet himself had illimitably invaded the atlantic and pacific_ and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed_ yet had he in his straight_bodied coat_ spilled tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore_ how now in the contemplative evening of his days_ the pious bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence_ i do not know_ but it did not seem to concern him much_ and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man_s religion is one thing_ and this practical world quite another_ this world pays dividends_ rising from a little cabin_boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab_ to a harpooneer in a broad shad_bellied waistcoat_ from that becoming boat_header_ chief_mate_ and captain_ and finally a ship owner_ bildad_ as i hinted before_ had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of sixty_ and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his well_earned income_ now_ bildad_ i am sorry to say_ had the reputation of being an incorrigible old hunks_ and in his sea_going days_ a bitter_ hard task_master_ they told me in nantucket_ though it certainly seems a curious story_ that when he sailed the old categut whaleman_ his crew_ upon arriving home_ were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital_ sore exhausted and worn out_ for a pious man_ especially for a quaker_ he was certainly rather hard_hearted_ to say the least_ he never used to swear_ though_ at his men_ they said_ but somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel_ unmitigated hard work out of them_ when bildad was a chief_mate_ to have his drab_coloured eye intently looking at you_ made you feel completely nervous_ till you could clutch something_a hammer or a marling_spike_ and go to work like mad_ at something or other_ never mind what_ indolence and idleness perished before him_ his own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character_ on his long_ gaunt body_ he carried no spare flesh_ no superfluous beard_ his chin having a soft_ economical nap to it_ like the worn nap of his broad_brimmed hat_ such_ then_ was the person that i saw seated on the transom when i followed captain peleg down into the cabin_ the space between the decks was small_ and there_ bolt_upright_ sat old bildad_ who always sat so_ and never leaned_ and this to save his coat tails_ his broad_brim was placed beside him_ his legs were stiffly crossed_ his drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin_ and spectacles on nose_ he seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume_ _bildad__ cried captain peleg_ _at it again_ bildad_ eh_ ye have been studying those scriptures_ now_ for the last thirty years_ to my certain knowledge_ how far ye got_ bildad__ as if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate_ bildad_ without noticing his present irreverence_ quietly looked up_ and seeing me_ glanced again inquiringly towards peleg_ _he says he_s our man_ bildad__ said peleg_ _he wants to ship__ _dost thee__ said bildad_ in a hollow tone_ and turning round to me_ _i dost__ said i unconsciously_ he was so intense a quaker_ _what do ye think of him_ bildad__ said peleg_ _he_ll do__ said bildad_ eyeing me_ and then went on spelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible_ i thought him the queerest old quaker i ever saw_ especially as peleg_ his friend and old shipmate_ seemed such a blusterer_ but i said nothing_ only looking round me sharply_ peleg now threw open a chest_ and drawing forth the ship_s articles_ placed pen and ink before him_ and seated himself at a little table_ i began to think it was high time to settle with myself at what terms i would be willing to engage for the voyage_ i was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages_ but all hands_ including the captain_ received certain shares of the profits called lays_ and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship_s company_ i was also aware that being a green hand at whaling_ my own lay would not be very large_ but considering that i was used to the sea_ could steer a ship_ splice a rope_ and all that_ i made no doubt that from all i had heard i should be offered at least the ___th lay_that is_ the ___th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage_ whatever that might eventually amount to_ and though the ___th lay was what they call a rather long lay_ yet it was better than nothing_ and if we had a lucky voyage_ might pretty nearly pay for the clothing i would wear out on it_ not to speak of my three years_ beef and board_ for which i would not have to pay one stiver_ it might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely fortune_and so it was_ a very poor way indeed_ but i am one of those that never take on about princely fortunes_ and am quite content if the world is ready to board and lodge me_ while i am putting up at this grim sign of the thunder cloud_ upon the whole_ i thought that the ___th lay would be about the fair thing_ but would not have been surprised had i been offered the ___th_ considering i was of a broad_shouldered make_ but one thing_ nevertheless_ that made me a little distrustful about receiving a generous share of the profits was this_ ashore_ i had heard something of both captain peleg and his unaccountable old crony bildad_ how that they being the principal proprietors of the pequod_ therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners_ left nearly the whole management of the ship_s affairs to these two_ and i did not know but what the stingy old bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping hands_ especially as i now found him on board the pequod_ quite at home there in the cabin_ and reading his bible as if at his own fireside_ now while peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack_knife_ old bildad_ to my no small surprise_ considering that he was such an interested party in these proceedings_ bildad never heeded us_ but went on mumbling to himself out of his book_ _lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth_ where moth__ _well_ captain bildad__ interrupted peleg_ _what d_ye say_ what lay shall we give this young man__ _thou knowest best__ was the sepulchral reply_ _the seven hundred and seventy_seventh wouldn_t be too much_ would it___where moth and rust do corrupt_ but lay___ lay_ indeed_ thought i_ and such a lay_ the seven hundred and seventy_seventh_ well_ old bildad_ you are determined that i_ for one_ shall not lay up many lays here below_ where moth and rust do corrupt_ it was an exceedingly long lay that_ indeed_ and though from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman_ yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and seventy_seven is a pretty large number_ yet_ when you come to make a teenth of it_ you will then see_ i say_ that the seven hundred and seventy_seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and seventy_seven gold doubloons_ and so i thought at the time_ _why_ blast your eyes_ bildad__ cried peleg_ _thou dost not want to swindle this young man_ he must have more than that__ _seven hundred and seventy_seventh__ again said bildad_ without lifting his eyes_ and then went on mumbling__for where your treasure is_ there will your heart be also__ _i am going to put him down for the three hundredth__ said peleg_ _do ye hear that_ bildad_ the three hundredth lay_ i say__ bildad laid down his book_ and turning solemnly towards him said_ _captain peleg_ thou hast a generous heart_ but thou must consider the duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship_widows and orphans_ many of them_and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young man_ we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans_ the seven hundred and seventy_seventh lay_ captain peleg__ _thou bildad__ roared peleg_ starting up and clattering about the cabin_ _blast ye_ captain bildad_ if i had followed thy advice in these matters_ i would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round cape horn__ _captain peleg__ said bildad steadily_ _thy conscience may be drawing ten inches of water_ or ten fathoms_ i can_t tell_ but as thou art still an impenitent man_ captain peleg_ i greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one_ and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit_ captain peleg__ _fiery pit_ fiery pit_ ye insult me_ man_ past all natural bearing_ ye insult me_ it_s an all_fired outrage to tell any human creature that he_s bound to hell_ flukes and flames_ bildad_ say that again to me_ and start my soul_bolts_ but i_ll_i_ll_yes_ i_ll swallow a live goat with all his hair and horns on_ out of the cabin_ ye canting_ drab_coloured son of a wooden gun_a straight wake with ye__ as he thundered out this he made a rush at bildad_ but with a marvellous oblique_ sliding celerity_ bildad for that time eluded him_ alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible owners of the ship_ and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily commanded_ i stepped aside from the door to give egress to bildad_ who_ i made no doubt_ was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath of peleg_ but to my astonishment_ he sat down again on the transom very quietly_ and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing_ he seemed quite used to impenitent peleg and his ways_ as for peleg_ after letting off his rage as he had_ there seemed no more left in him_ and he_ too_ sat down like a lamb_ though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated_ _whew__ he whistled at last__the squall_s gone off to leeward_ i think_ bildad_ thou used to be good at sharpening a lance_ mend that pen_ will ye_ my jack_knife here needs the grindstone_ that_s he_ thank ye_ bildad_ now then_ my young man_ ishmael_s thy name_ didn_t ye say_ well then_ down ye go here_ ishmael_ for the three hundredth lay__ _captain peleg__ said i_ _i have a friend with me who wants to ship too_shall i bring him down to_morrow__ _to be sure__ said peleg_ _fetch him along_ and we_ll look at him__ _what lay does he want__ groaned bildad_ glancing up from the book in which he had again been burying himself_ _oh_ never thee mind about that_ bildad__ said peleg_ _has he ever whaled it any__ turning to me_ _killed more whales than i can count_ captain peleg__ _well_ bring him along then__ and_ after signing the papers_ off i went_ nothing doubting but that i had done a good morning_s work_ and that the pequod was the identical ship that yojo had provided to carry queequeg and me round the cape_ but i had not proceeded far_ when i began to bethink me that the captain with whom i was to sail yet remained unseen by me_ though_ indeed_ in many cases_ a whale_ship will be completely fitted out_ and receive all her crew on board_ ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving to take command_ for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged_ and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief_ that if the captain have a family_ or any absorbing concernment of that sort_ he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port_ but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea_ however_ it is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands_ turning back i accosted captain peleg_ inquiring where captain ahab was to be found_ _and what dost thou want of captain ahab_ it_s all right enough_ thou art shipped__ _yes_ but i should like to see him__ _but i don_t think thou wilt be able to at present_ i don_t know exactly what_s the matter with him_ but he keeps close inside the house_ a sort of sick_ and yet he don_t look so_ in fact_ he ain_t sick_ but no_ he isn_t well either_ any how_ young man_ he won_t always see me_ so i don_t suppose he will thee_ he_s a queer man_ captain ahab_so some think_but a good one_ oh_ thou_lt like him well enough_ no fear_ no fear_ he_s a grand_ ungodly_ god_like man_ captain ahab_ doesn_t speak much_ but_ when he does speak_ then you may well listen_ mark ye_ be forewarned_ ahab_s above the common_ ahab_s been in colleges_ as well as _mong the cannibals_ been used to deeper wonders than the waves_ fixed his fiery lance in mightier_ stranger foes than whales_ his lance_ aye_ the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle_ oh_ he ain_t captain bildad_ no_ and he ain_t captain peleg_ he_s ahab_ boy_ and ahab of old_ thou knowest_ was a crowned king__ _and a very vile one_ when that wicked king was slain_ the dogs_ did they not lick his blood__ _come hither to me_hither_ hither__ said peleg_ with a significance in his eye that almost startled me_ _look ye_ lad_ never say that on board the pequod_ never say it anywhere_ captain ahab did not name himself_ _twas a foolish_ ignorant whim of his crazy_ widowed mother_ who died when he was only a twelvemonth old_ and yet the old squaw tistig_ at gayhead_ said that the name would somehow prove prophetic_ and_ perhaps_ other fools like her may tell thee the same_ i wish to warn thee_ it_s a lie_ i know captain ahab well_ i_ve sailed with him as mate years ago_ i know what he is_a good man_not a pious_ good man_ like bildad_ but a swearing good man_something like me_only there_s a good deal more of him_ aye_ aye_ i know that he was never very jolly_ and i know that on the passage home_ he was a little out of his mind for a spell_ but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that about_ as any one might see_ i know_ too_ that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale_ he_s been a kind of moody_desperate moody_ and savage sometimes_ but that will all pass off_ and once for all_ let me tell thee and assure thee_ young man_ it_s better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one_ so good_bye to thee_and wrong not captain ahab_ because he happens to have a wicked name_ besides_ my boy_ he has a wife_not three voyages wedded_a sweet_ resigned girl_ think of that_ by that sweet girl that old man has a child_ hold ye then there can be any utter_ hopeless harm in ahab_ no_ no_ my lad_ stricken_ blasted_ if he be_ ahab has his humanities__ as i walked away_ i was full of thoughtfulness_ what had been incidentally revealed to me of captain ahab_ filled me with a certain wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him_ and somehow_ at the time_ i felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him_ but for i don_t know what_ unless it was the cruel loss of his leg_ and yet i also felt a strange awe of him_ but that sort of awe_ which i cannot at all describe_ was not exactly awe_ i do not know what it was_ but i felt it_ and it did not disincline me towards him_ though i felt impatience at what seemed like mystery in him_ so imperfectly as he was known to me then_ however_ my thoughts were at length carried in other directions_ so that for the present dark ahab slipped my mind_ chapter ___ the ramadan_ as queequeg_s ramadan_ or fasting and humiliation_ was to continue all day_ i did not choose to disturb him till towards night_fall_ for i cherish the greatest respect towards everybody_s religious obligations_ never mind how comical_ and could not find it in my heart to undervalue even a congregation of ants worshipping a toad_stool_ or those other creatures in certain parts of our earth_ who with a degree of footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets_ bow down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his name_ i say_ we good presbyterian christians should be charitable in these things_ and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals_ pagans and what not_ because of their half_crazy conceits on these subjects_ there was queequeg_ now_ certainly entertaining the most absurd notions about yojo and his ramadan__but what of that_ queequeg thought he knew what he was about_ i suppose_ he seemed to be content_ and there let him rest_ all our arguing with him would not avail_ let him be_ i say_ and heaven have mercy on us all_presbyterians and pagans alike_for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head_ and sadly need mending_ towards evening_ when i felt assured that all his performances and rituals must be over_ i went up to his room and knocked at the door_ but no answer_ i tried to open it_ but it was fastened inside_ _queequeg__ said i softly through the key_hole__all silent_ _i say_ queequeg_ why don_t you speak_ it_s i_ishmael__ but all remained still as before_ i began to grow alarmed_ i had allowed him such abundant time_ i thought he might have had an apoplectic fit_ i looked through the key_hole_ but the door opening into an odd corner of the room_ the key_hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one_ i could only see part of the foot_board of the bed and a line of the wall_ but nothing more_ i was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden shaft of queequeg_s harpoon_ which the landlady the evening previous had taken from him_ before our mounting to the chamber_ that_s strange_ thought i_ but at any rate_ since the harpoon stands yonder_ and he seldom or never goes abroad without it_ therefore he must be inside here_ and no possible mistake_ _queequeg__queequeg___all still_ something must have happened_ apoplexy_ i tried to burst open the door_ but it stubbornly resisted_ running down stairs_ i quickly stated my suspicions to the first person i met_the chamber_maid_ _la_ la__ she cried_ _i thought something must be the matter_ i went to make the bed after breakfast_ and the door was locked_ and not a mouse to be heard_ and it_s been just so silent ever since_ but i thought_ may be_ you had both gone off and locked your baggage in for safe keeping_ la_ la_ ma_am__mistress_ murder_ mrs_ hussey_ apoplexy___and with these cries_ she ran towards the kitchen_ i following_ mrs_ hussey soon appeared_ with a mustard_pot in one hand and a vinegar_cruet in the other_ having just broken away from the occupation of attending to the castors_ and scolding her little black boy meantime_ _wood_house__ cried i_ _which way to it_ run for god_s sake_ and fetch something to pry open the door_the axe__the axe_ he_s had a stroke_ depend upon it___and so saying i was unmethodically rushing up stairs again empty_handed_ when mrs_ hussey interposed the mustard_pot and vinegar_cruet_ and the entire castor of her countenance_ _what_s the matter with you_ young man__ _get the axe_ for god_s sake_ run for the doctor_ some one_ while i pry it open__ _look here__ said the landlady_ quickly putting down the vinegar_cruet_ so as to have one hand free_ _look here_ are you talking about prying open any of my doors___and with that she seized my arm_ _what_s the matter with you_ what_s the matter with you_ shipmate__ in as calm_ but rapid a manner as possible_ i gave her to understand the whole case_ unconsciously clapping the vinegar_cruet to one side of her nose_ she ruminated for an instant_ then exclaimed__no_ i haven_t seen it since i put it there__ running to a little closet under the landing of the stairs_ she glanced in_ and returning_ told me that queequeg_s harpoon was missing_ _he_s killed himself__ she cried_ _it_s unfort_nate stiggs done over again_there goes another counterpane_god pity his poor mother__it will be the ruin of my house_ has the poor lad a sister_ where_s that girl__there_ betty_ go to snarles the painter_ and tell him to paint me a sign_ with__no suicides permitted here_ and no smoking in the parlor___might as well kill both birds at once_ kill_ the lord be merciful to his ghost_ what_s that noise there_ you_ young man_ avast there__ and running up after me_ she caught me as i was again trying to force open the door_ _i don_t allow it_ i won_t have my premises spoiled_ go for the locksmith_ there_s one about a mile from here_ but avast__ putting her hand in her side_pocket_ _here_s a key that_ll fit_ i guess_ let_s see__ and with that_ she turned it in the lock_ but_ alas_ queequeg_s supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within_ _have to burst it open__ said i_ and was running down the entry a little_ for a good start_ when the landlady caught at me_ again vowing i should not break down her premises_ but i tore from her_ and with a sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark_ with a prodigious noise the door flew open_ and the knob slamming against the wall_ sent the plaster to the ceiling_ and there_ good heavens_ there sat queequeg_ altogether cool and self_collected_ right in the middle of the room_ squatting on his hams_ and holding yojo on top of his head_ he looked neither one way nor the other way_ but sat like a carved image with scarce a sign of active life_ _queequeg__ said i_ going up to him_ _queequeg_ what_s the matter with you__ _he hain_t been a sittin_ so all day_ has he__ said the landlady_ but all we said_ not a word could we drag out of him_ i almost felt like pushing him over_ so as to change his position_ for it was almost intolerable_ it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained_ especially_ as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of eight or ten hours_ going too without his regular meals_ _mrs_ hussey__ said i_ _he_s alive at all events_ so leave us_ if you please_ and i will see to this strange affair myself__ closing the door upon the landlady_ i endeavored to prevail upon queequeg to take a chair_ but in vain_ there he sat_ and all he could do_for all my polite arts and blandishments_he would not move a peg_ nor say a single word_ nor even look at me_ nor notice my presence in the slightest way_ i wonder_ thought i_ if this can possibly be a part of his ramadan_ do they fast on their hams that way in his native island_ it must be so_ yes_ it_s part of his creed_ i suppose_ well_ then_ let him rest_ he_ll get up sooner or later_ no doubt_ it can_t last for ever_ thank god_ and his ramadan only comes once a year_ and i don_t believe it_s very punctual then_ i went down to supper_ after sitting a long time listening to the long stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum_pudding voyage_ as they called it _that is_ a short whaling_voyage in a schooner or brig_ confined to the north of the line_ in the atlantic ocean only__ after listening to these plum_puddingers till nearly eleven o_clock_ i went up stairs to go to bed_ feeling quite sure by this time queequeg must certainly have brought his ramadan to a termination_ but no_ there he was just where i had left him_ he had not stirred an inch_ i began to grow vexed with him_ it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room_ holding a piece of wood on his head_ _for heaven_s sake_ queequeg_ get up and shake yourself_ get up and have some supper_ you_ll starve_ you_ll kill yourself_ queequeg__ but not a word did he reply_ despairing of him_ therefore_ i determined to go to bed and to sleep_ and no doubt_ before a great while_ he would follow me_ but previous to turning in_ i took my heavy bearskin jacket_ and threw it over him_ as it promised to be a very cold night_ and he had nothing but his ordinary round jacket on_ for some time_ do all i would_ i could not get into the faintest doze_ i had blown out the candle_ and the mere thought of queequeg_not four feet off_sitting there in that uneasy position_ stark alone in the cold and dark_ this made me really wretched_ think of it_ sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan on his hams in this dreary_ unaccountable ramadan_ but somehow i dropped off at last_ and knew nothing more till break of day_ when_ looking over the bedside_ there squatted queequeg_ as if he had been screwed down to the floor_ but as soon as the first glimpse of sun entered the window_ up he got_ with stiff and grating joints_ but with a cheerful look_ limped towards me where i lay_ pressed his forehead again against mine_ and said his ramadan was over_ now_ as i before hinted_ i have no objection to any person_s religion_ be it what it may_ so long as that person does not kill or insult any other person_ because that other person don_t believe it also_ but when a man_s religion becomes really frantic_ when it is a positive torment to him_ and_ in fine_ makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to lodge in_ then i think it high time to take that individual aside and argue the point with him_ and just so i now did with queequeg_ _queequeg__ said i_ _get into bed now_ and lie and listen to me__ i then went on_ beginning with the rise and progress of the primitive religions_ and coming down to the various religions of the present time_ during which time i labored to show queequeg that all these lents_ ramadans_ and prolonged ham_squattings in cold_ cheerless rooms were stark nonsense_ bad for the health_ useless for the soul_ opposed_ in short_ to the obvious laws of hygiene and common sense_ i told him_ too_ that he being in other things such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage_ it pained me_ very badly pained me_ to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous ramadan of his_ besides_ argued i_ fasting makes the body cave in_ hence the spirit caves in_ and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half_starved_ this is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters_ in one word_ queequeg_ said i_ rather digressively_ hell is an idea first born on an undigested apple_dumpling_ and since then perpetuated through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by ramadans_ i then asked queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with dyspepsia_ expressing the idea very plainly_ so that he could take it in_ he said no_ only upon one memorable occasion_ it was after a great feast given by his father the king_ on the gaining of a great battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o_clock in the afternoon_ and all cooked and eaten that very evening_ _no more_ queequeg__ said i_ shuddering_ _that will do__ for i knew the inferences without his further hinting them_ i had seen a sailor who had visited that very island_ and he told me that it was the custom_ when a great battle had been gained there_ to barbecue all the slain in the yard or garden of the victor_ and then_ one by one_ they were placed in great wooden trenchers_ and garnished round like a pilau_ with breadfruit and cocoanuts_ and with some parsley in their mouths_ were sent round with the victor_s compliments to all his friends_ just as though these presents were so many christmas turkeys_ after all_ i do not think that my remarks about religion made much impression upon queequeg_ because_ in the first place_ he somehow seemed dull of hearing on that important subject_ unless considered from his own point of view_ and_ in the second place_ he did not more than one third understand me_ couch my ideas simply as i would_ and_ finally_ he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than i did_ he looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and compassion_ as though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety_ at last we rose and dressed_ and queequeg_ taking a prodigiously hearty breakfast of chowders of all sorts_ so that the landlady should not make much profit by reason of his ramadan_ we sallied out to board the pequod_ sauntering along_ and picking our teeth with halibut bones_ chapter ___ his mark_ as we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship_ queequeg carrying his harpoon_ captain peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us from his wigwam_ saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal_ and furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft_ unless they previously produced their papers_ _what do you mean by that_ captain peleg__ said i_ now jumping on the bulwarks_ and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf_ _i mean__ he replied_ _he must show his papers__ _yes__ said captain bildad in his hollow voice_ sticking his head from behind peleg_s_ out of the wigwam_ _he must show that he_s converted_ son of darkness__ he added_ turning to queequeg_ _art thou at present in communion with any christian church__ _why__ said i_ _he_s a member of the first congregational church__ here be it said_ that many tattooed savages sailing in nantucket ships at last come to be converted into the churches_ _first congregational church__ cried bildad_ _what_ that worships in deacon deuteronomy coleman_s meeting_house__ and so saying_ taking out his spectacles_ he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana handkerchief_ and putting them on very carefully_ came out of the wigwam_ and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks_ took a good long look at queequeg_ _how long hath he been a member__ he then said_ turning to me_ _not very long_ i rather guess_ young man__ _no__ said peleg_ _and he hasn_t been baptized right either_ or it would have washed some of that devil_s blue off his face__ _do tell_ now__ cried bildad_ _is this philistine a regular member of deacon deuteronomy_s meeting_ i never saw him going there_ and i pass it every lord_s day__ _i don_t know anything about deacon deuteronomy or his meeting__ said i_ _all i know is_ that queequeg here is a born member of the first congregational church_ he is a deacon himself_ queequeg is__ _young man__ said bildad sternly_ _thou art skylarking with me_explain thyself_ thou young hittite_ what church dost thee mean_ answer me__ finding myself thus hard pushed_ i replied_ _i mean_ sir_ the same ancient catholic church to which you and i_ and captain peleg there_ and queequeg here_ and all of us_ and every mother_s son and soul of us belong_ the great and everlasting first congregation of this whole worshipping world_ we all belong to that_ only some of us cherish some queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief_ in that we all join hands__ _splice_ thou mean_st splice hands__ cried peleg_ drawing nearer_ _young man_ you_d better ship for a missionary_ instead of a fore_mast hand_ i never heard a better sermon_ deacon deuteronomy_why father mapple himself couldn_t beat it_ and he_s reckoned something_ come aboard_ come aboard_ never mind about the papers_ i say_ tell quohog there_what_s that you call him_ tell quohog to step along_ by the great anchor_ what a harpoon he_s got there_ looks like good stuff that_ and he handles it about right_ i say_ quohog_ or whatever your name is_ did you ever stand in the head of a whale_boat_ did you ever strike a fish__ without saying a word_ queequeg_ in his wild sort of way_ jumped upon the bulwarks_ from thence into the bows of one of the whale_boats hanging to the side_ and then bracing his left knee_ and poising his harpoon_ cried out in some such way as this__ _cap_ain_ you see him small drop tar on water dere_ you see him_ well_ spose him one whale eye_ well_ den__ and taking sharp aim at it_ he darted the iron right over old bildad_s broad brim_ clean across the ship_s decks_ and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight_ _now__ said queequeg_ quietly hauling in the line_ _spos_ee him whale_e eye_ why_ dad whale dead__ _quick_ bildad__ said peleg_ his partner_ who_ aghast at the close vicinity of the flying harpoon_ had retreated towards the cabin gangway_ _quick_ i say_ you bildad_ and get the ship_s papers_ we must have hedgehog there_ i mean quohog_ in one of our boats_ look ye_ quohog_ we_ll give ye the ninetieth lay_ and that_s more than ever was given a harpooneer yet out of nantucket__ so down we went into the cabin_ and to my great joy queequeg was soon enrolled among the same ship_s company to which i myself belonged_ when all preliminaries were over and peleg had got everything ready for signing_ he turned to me and said_ _i guess_ quohog there don_t know how to write_ does he_ i say_ quohog_ blast ye_ dost thou sign thy name or make thy mark__ but at this question_ queequeg_ who had twice or thrice before taken part in similar ceremonies_ looked no ways abashed_ but taking the offered pen_ copied upon the paper_ in the proper place_ an exact counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm_ so that through captain peleg_s obstinate mistake touching his appellative_ it stood something like this__ quohog_ his x mark_ meanwhile captain bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing queequeg_ and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his broad_skirted drab coat_ took out a bundle of tracts_ and selecting one entitled _the latter day coming_ or no time to lose__ placed it in queequeg_s hands_ and then grasping them and the book with both his_ looked earnestly into his eyes_ and said_ _son of darkness_ i must do my duty by thee_ i am part owner of this ship_ and feel concerned for the souls of all its crew_ if thou still clingest to thy pagan ways_ which i sadly fear_ i beseech thee_ remain not for aye a belial bondsman_ spurn the idol bell_ and the hideous dragon_ turn from the wrath to come_ mind thine eye_ i say_ oh_ goodness gracious_ steer clear of the fiery pit__ something of the salt sea yet lingered in old bildad_s language_ heterogeneously mixed with scriptural and domestic phrases_ _avast there_ avast there_ bildad_ avast now spoiling our harpooneer__ cried peleg_ _pious harpooneers never make good voyagers_it takes the shark out of _em_ no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty sharkish_ there was young nat swaine_ once the bravest boat_header out of all nantucket and the vineyard_ he joined the meeting_ and never came to good_ he got so frightened about his plaguy soul_ that he shrinked and sheered away from whales_ for fear of after_claps_ in case he got stove and went to davy jones__ _peleg_ peleg__ said bildad_ lifting his eyes and hands_ _thou thyself_ as i myself_ hast seen many a perilous time_ thou knowest_ peleg_ what it is to have the fear of death_ how_ then_ can_st thou prate in this ungodly guise_ thou beliest thine own heart_ peleg_ tell me_ when this same pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on japan_ that same voyage when thou went mate with captain ahab_ did_st thou not think of death and the judgment then__ _hear him_ hear him now__ cried peleg_ marching across the cabin_ and thrusting his hands far down into his pockets___hear him_ all of ye_ think of that_ when every moment we thought the ship would sink_ death and the judgment then_ what_ with all three masts making such an everlasting thundering against the side_ and every sea breaking over us_ fore and aft_

nearest port_ that was what i was thinking of__ bildad said no more_ but buttoning up his coat_ stalked on deck_ where we followed him_ there he stood_ very quietly overlooking some sailmakers who were mending a top_sail in the waist_ now and then he stooped to pick up a patch_ or save an end of tarred twine_ which otherwise might have been wasted_ chapter ___ the prophet_ _shipmates_ have ye shipped in that ship__ queequeg and i had just left the pequod_ and were sauntering away from the water_ for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts_ when the above words were put to us by a stranger_ who_ pausing before us_ levelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question_ he was but shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers_ a rag of a black handkerchief investing his neck_ a confluent small_pox had in all directions flowed over his face_ and left it like the complicated ribbed bed of a torrent_ when the rushing waters have been dried up_ _have ye shipped in her__ he repeated_ _you mean the ship pequod_ i suppose__ said i_ trying to gain a little more time for an uninterrupted look at him_ _aye_ the pequod_that ship there__ he said_ drawing back his whole arm_ and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him_ with the fixed bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object_ _yes__ said i_ _we have just signed the articles__ _anything down there about your souls__ _about what__ _oh_ perhaps you hav_n_t got any__ he said quickly_ _no matter though_ i know many chaps that hav_n_t got any__good luck to _em_ and they are all the better off for it_ a soul_s a sort of a fifth wheel to a wagon__ _what are you jabbering about_ shipmate__ said i_ _he_s got enough_ though_ to make up for all deficiencies of that sort in other chaps__ abruptly said the stranger_ placing a nervous emphasis upon the word he_ _queequeg__ said i_ _let_s go_ this fellow has broken loose from somewhere_ he_s talking about something and somebody we don_t know__ _stop__ cried the stranger_ _ye said true_ye hav_n_t seen old thunder yet_ have ye__ _who_s old thunder__ said i_ again riveted with the insane earnestness of his manner_ _captain ahab__ _what_ the captain of our ship_ the pequod__ _aye_ among some of us old sailor chaps_ he goes by that name_ ye hav_n_t seen him yet_ have ye__ _no_ we hav_n_t_ he_s sick they say_ but is getting better_ and will be all right again before long__ _all right again before long__ laughed the stranger_ with a solemnly derisive sort of laugh_ _look ye_ when captain ahab is all right_ then this left arm of mine will be all right_ not before__ _what do you know about him__ _what did they tell you about him_ say that__ _they didn_t tell much of anything about him_ only i_ve heard that he_s a good whale_hunter_ and a good captain to his crew__ _that_s true_ that_s true_yes_ both true enough_ but you must jump when he gives an order_ step and growl_ growl and go_that_s the word with captain ahab_ but nothing about that thing that happened to him off cape horn_ long ago_ when he lay like dead for three days and nights_ nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the spaniard afore

about them matters and something more_ eh_ no_ i don_t think ye did_ how could ye_ who knows it_ not all nantucket_ i guess_ but hows_ever_ mayhap_ ye_ve heard tell about the leg_ and how he lost it_ aye_ ye have heard of that_ i dare say_ oh yes_ that every one knows a_most_i mean they know he_s only one leg_ and that a parmacetti took the other off__ _my friend__ said i_ _what all this gibberish of yours is about_ i don_t know_ and i don_t much care_ for it seems to me that you must be a little damaged in the head_ but if you are speaking of captain ahab_ of that ship there_ the pequod_ then

will you__ _elijah__ elijah_ thought i_ and we walked away_ both commenting_ after each other_s fashion_ upon this ragged old sailor_ and agreed that he was nothing but a humbug_ trying to be a bugbear_ but we had not gone perhaps above a hundred yards_ when chancing to turn a corner_ and looking back as i did so_ who should be seen but elijah following us_ though at a distance_ somehow_ the sight of him struck me so_ that i said nothing to queequeg of his being behind_ but passed on with my comrade_ anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner that we did_ he did_ and then it seemed to me that he was dogging us_ but with what intent i could not for the life of me imagine_ this circumstance_ coupled with his ambiguous_ half_hinting_ half_revealing_ shrouded sort of talk_ now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments and half_apprehensions_ and all connected with the pequod_ and captain ahab_ and the leg he had lost_ and the cape horn fit_ and the silver calabash_ and what captain peleg had said of him_ when i left the ship the day previous_ and the prediction of the squaw tistig_ and the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail_ and a hundred other shadowy things_ i was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged elijah was really dogging us or not_ and with that intent crossed the way with queequeg_ and on that side of it retraced our steps_ but elijah passed on_ without seeming to notice us_ this relieved me_ and once more_ and finally as it seemed to me_ i pronounced him in my heart_ a humbug_ chapter ___ all astir_ a day or two passed_ and there was great activity aboard the pequod_ not only were the old sails being mended_ but new sails were coming on board_ and bolts of canvas_ and coils of rigging_ in short_ everything betokened that the ship_s preparations were hurrying to a close_ captain peleg seldom or never went ashore_ but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp look_out upon the hands_ bildad did all the purchasing and providing at the stores_ and the men employed in the hold and on the rigging were working till long after night_fall_ on the day following queequeg_s signing the articles_ word was given at all the inns where the ship_s company were stopping_ that their chests must be on board before night_ for there was no telling how soon the vessel might be sailing_ so queequeg and i got down our traps_ resolving_ however_ to sleep ashore till the last_ but it seems they always give very long notice in these cases_ and the ship did not sail for several days_ but no wonder_ there was a good deal to be done_ and there is no telling how many things to be thought of_ before the pequod was fully equipped_ every one knows what a multitude of things_beds_ sauce_pans_ knives and forks_ shovels and tongs_ napkins_ nut_crackers_ and what not_ are indispensable to the business of housekeeping_ just so with whaling_ which necessitates a three_years_ housekeeping upon the wide ocean_ far from all grocers_ costermongers_ doctors_ bakers_ and bankers_ and though this also holds true of merchant vessels_ yet not by any means to the same extent as with whalemen_ for besides the great length of the whaling voyage_ the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution of the fishery_ and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote harbors usually frequented_ it must be remembered_ that of all ships_ whaling vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds_ and especially to the destruction and loss of the very things upon which the success of the voyage most depends_ hence_ the spare boats_ spare spars_ and spare lines and harpoons_ and spare everythings_ almost_ but a spare captain and duplicate ship_ at the period of our arrival at the island_ the heaviest storage of the pequod had been almost completed_ comprising her beef_ bread_ water_ fuel_ and iron hoops and staves_ but_ as before hinted_ for some time there was a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds and ends of things_ both large and small_ chief among those who did this fetching and carrying was captain bildad_s sister_ a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable spirit_ but withal very kindhearted_ who seemed resolved that_ if she could help it_ nothing should be found wanting in the pequod_ after once fairly getting to sea_ at one time she would come on board with a jar of pickles for the steward_s pantry_ another time with a bunch of quills for the chief mate_s desk_ where he kept his log_ a third time with a roll of flannel for the small of some one_s rheumatic back_ never did any woman better deserve her name_ which was charity_aunt charity_ as everybody called her_ and like a sister of charity did this charitable aunt charity bustle about hither and thither_ ready to turn her hand and heart to anything that promised to yield safety_ comfort_ and consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother bildad was concerned_ and in which she herself owned a score or two of well_saved dollars_ but it was startling to see this excellent hearted quakeress coming on board_ as she did the last day_ with a long oil_ladle in one hand_ and a still longer whaling lance in the other_ nor was bildad himself nor captain peleg at all backward_ as for bildad_ he carried about with him a long list of the articles needed_ and at every fresh arrival_ down went his mark opposite that article upon the paper_ every once in a while peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den_ roaring at the men down the hatchways_ roaring up to the riggers at the mast_head_ and then concluded by roaring back into his wigwam_ during these days of preparation_ queequeg and i often visited the craft_ and as often i asked about captain ahab_ and how he was_ and when he was going to come on board his ship_ to these questions they would answer_ that he was getting better and better_ and was expected aboard every day_ meantime_ the two captains_ peleg and bildad_ could attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage_ if i had been downright honest with myself_ i would have seen very plainly in my heart that i did but half fancy being committed this way to so long a voyage_ without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the absolute dictator of it_ so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea_ but when a man suspects any wrong_ it sometimes happens that if he be already involved in the matter_ he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself_ and much this way it was with me_ i said nothing_ and tried to think nothing_ at last it was given out that some time next day the ship would certainly sail_ so next morning_ queequeg and i took a very early start_ chapter ___ going aboard_ it was nearly six o_clock_ but only grey imperfect misty dawn_ when we drew nigh the wharf_ _there are some sailors running ahead there_ if i see right__ said i to queequeg_ _it can_t be shadows_ she_s off by sunrise_ i guess_ come on__ _avast__ cried a voice_ whose owner at the same time coming close behind us_ laid a hand upon both our shoulders_ and then insinuating himself between us_ stood stooping forward a little_ in the uncertain twilight_ strangely peering from queequeg to me_ it was elijah_ _going aboard__ _hands off_ will you__ said i_ _lookee here__ said queequeg_ shaking himself_ _go _way__ _ain_t going aboard_ then__ _yes_ we are__ said i_ _but what business is that of yours_ do you know_ mr_ elijah_ that i consider you a little impertinent__ _no_ no_ no_ i wasn_t aware of that__ said elijah_ slowly and wonderingly looking from me to queequeg_ with the most unaccountable glances_ _elijah__ said i_ _you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing_ we are going to the indian and pacific oceans_ and would prefer not to be detained__ _ye be_ be ye_ coming back afore breakfast__ _he_s cracked_ queequeg__ said i_ _come on__ _holloa__ cried stationary elijah_ hailing us when we had removed a few paces_ _never mind him__ said i_ _queequeg_ come on__ but he stole up to us again_ and suddenly clapping his hand on my shoulder_ said__did ye see anything looking like men going towards that ship a while ago__ struck by this plain matter_of_fact question_ i answered_ saying_ _yes_ i thought i did see four or five men_ but it was too dim to be sure__ _very dim_ very dim__ said elijah_ _morning to ye__ once more we quitted him_ but once more he came softly after us_ and touching my shoulder again_ said_ _see if you can find _em now_ will ye_ _find who__ _morning to ye_ morning to ye__ he rejoined_ again moving off_ _oh_ i was going to warn ye against_but never mind_ never mind_it_s all one_ all in the family too__sharp frost this morning_ ain_t it_ good_bye to ye_ shan_t see ye again very soon_ i guess_ unless it_s before the grand jury__ and with these cracked words he finally departed_ leaving me_ for the moment_ in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence_ at last_ stepping on board the pequod_ we found everything in profound quiet_ not a soul moving_ the cabin entrance was locked within_ the hatches were all on_ and lumbered with coils of rigging_ going forward to the forecastle_ we found the slide of the scuttle open_ seeing a light_ we went down_ and found only an old rigger there_ wrapped in a tattered pea_jacket_ he was thrown at whole length upon two chests_ his face downwards and inclosed in his folded arms_ the profoundest slumber slept upon him_ _those sailors we saw_ queequeg_ where can they have gone to__ said i_ looking dubiously at the sleeper_ but it seemed that_ when on the wharf_ queequeg had not at all noticed what i now alluded to_ hence i would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that matter_ were it not for elijah_s otherwise inexplicable question_ but i beat the thing down_ and again marking the sleeper_ jocularly hinted to queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body_ telling him to establish himself accordingly_ he put his hand upon the sleeper_s rear_ as though feeling if it was soft enough_ and then_ without more ado_ sat quietly down there_ _gracious_ queequeg_ don_t sit there__ said i_ _oh_ perry dood seat__ said queequeg_ _my country way_ won_t hurt him face__ _face__ said i_ _call that his face_ very benevolent countenance then_ but how hard he breathes_ he_s heaving himself_ get off_ queequeg_ you are heavy_ it_s grinding the face of the poor_ get off_ queequeg_ look_ he_ll twitch you off soon_ i wonder he don_t wake__ queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper_ and lighted his tomahawk pipe_ i sat at the feet_ we kept the pipe passing over the sleeper_ from one to the other_ meanwhile_ upon questioning him in his broken fashion_ queequeg gave me to understand that_ in his land_ owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts_ the king_ chiefs_ and great people generally_ were in the custom of fattening some of the lower orders for ottomans_ and to furnish a house comfortably in that respect_ you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy fellows_ and lay them round in the piers and alcoves_ besides_ it was very convenient on an excursion_ much better than those garden_chairs which are convertible into walking_sticks_ upon occasion_ a chief calling his attendant_ and desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree_ perhaps in some damp marshy place_ while narrating these things_ every time queequeg received the tomahawk from me_ he flourished the hatchet_side of it over the sleeper_s head_ _what_s that for_ queequeg__ _perry easy_ kill_e_ oh_ perry easy__ he was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk_pipe_ which_ it seemed_ had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed his soul_ when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger_ the strong vapour now completely filling the contracted hole_ it began to tell upon him_ he breathed with a sort of muffledness_ then seemed troubled in the nose_ then revolved over once or twice_ then sat up and rubbed his eyes_ _holloa__ he breathed at last_ _who be ye smokers__ _shipped men__ answered i_ _when does she sail__ _aye_ aye_ ye are going in her_ be ye_ she sails to_day_ the captain came aboard last night__ _what captain__ahab__ _who but him indeed__ i was going to ask him some further questions concerning ahab_ when we heard a noise on deck_ _holloa_ starbuck_s astir__ said the rigger_ _he_s a lively chief mate_ that_ good man_ and a pious_ but all alive now_ i must turn to__ and so saying he went on deck_ and we followed_ it was now clear sunrise_ soon the crew came on board in twos and threes_ the riggers bestirred themselves_ the mates were actively engaged_ and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various last things on board_ meanwhile captain ahab remained invisibly enshrined within his cabin_ chapter ___ merry christmas_ at length_ towards noon_ upon the final dismissal of the ship_s riggers_ and after the pequod had been hauled out from the wharf_ and after the ever_thoughtful charity had come off in a whale_boat_ with her last gift_a night_cap for stubb_ the second mate_ her brother_in_law_ and a spare bible for the steward_after all this_ the two captains_ peleg and bildad_ issued from the cabin_ and turning to the chief mate_ peleg said_ _now_ mr_ starbuck_ are you sure everything is right_ captain ahab is all ready_just spoke to him_nothing more to be got from shore_ eh_ well_ call all hands_ then_ muster _em aft here_blast _em__ _no need of profane words_ however great the hurry_ peleg__ said bildad_ _but away with thee_ friend starbuck_ and do our bidding__ how now_ here upon the very point of starting for the voyage_ captain peleg and captain bildad were going it with a high hand on the quarter_deck_ just as if they were to be joint_commanders at sea_ as well as to all appearances in port_ and_ as for captain ahab_ no sign of him was yet to be seen_ only_ they said he was in the cabin_ but then_ the idea was_ that his presence was by no means necessary in getting the ship under weigh_ and steering her well out to sea_ indeed_ as that was not at all his proper business_ but the pilot_s_ and as he was not yet completely recovered_so they said_therefore_ captain ahab stayed below_ and all this seemed natural enough_ especially as in the merchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable time after heaving up the anchor_ but remain over the cabin table_ having a farewell merry_making with their shore friends_ before they quit the ship for good with the pilot_ but there was not much chance to think over the matter_ for captain peleg was now all alive_ he seemed to do most of the talking and commanding_ and not bildad_ _aft here_ ye sons of bachelors__ he cried_ as the sailors lingered at the main_mast_ _mr_ starbuck_ drive_em aft__ _strike the tent there___was the next order_ as i hinted before_ this whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port_ and on board the pequod_ for thirty years_ the order to strike the tent was well known to be the next thing to heaving up the anchor_ _man the capstan_ blood and thunder__jump___was the next command_ and the crew sprang for the handspikes_ now in getting under weigh_ the station generally occupied by the pilot is the forward part of the ship_ and here bildad_ who_ with peleg_ be it known_ in addition to his other officers_ was one of the licensed pilots of the port_he being suspected to have got himself made a pilot in order to save the nantucket pilot_fee to all the ships he was concerned in_ for he never piloted any other craft_bildad_ i say_ might now be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the approaching anchor_ and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody_ to cheer the hands at the windlass_ who roared forth some sort of a chorus about the girls in booble alley_ with hearty good will_ nevertheless_ not three days previous_ bildad had told them that no profane songs would be allowed on board the pequod_ particularly in getting under weigh_ and charity_ his sister_ had placed a small choice copy of watts in each seaman_s berth_ meantime_ overseeing the other part of the ship_ captain peleg ripped and swore astern in the most frightful manner_ i almost thought he would sink

nantucket_ and a quaker by descent_ he was a long_ earnest man_ and though born on an icy coast_ seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes_ his flesh being hard as twice_baked biscuit_ transported to the indies_ his live blood would not spoil like bottled ale_ he must have been born in some time of general drought and famine_ or upon one of those fast days for which his state is famous_ only some thirty arid summers had he seen_ those summers had dried up all his physical superfluousness_ but this_ his thinness_ so to speak_ seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties and cares_ than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight_ it was merely the condensation of the man_ he was by no means ill_looking_ quite the contrary_ his pure tight skin was an excellent fit_ and closely wrapped up in it_ and embalmed with inner health and strength_ like a revivified egyptian_ this starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to come_ and to endure always_ as now_ for be it polar snow or torrid sun_ like a patent chronometer_ his interior vitality was warranted to do well in all climates_ looking into his eyes_ you seemed to see there the yet lingering images of those thousand_fold perils he had calmly confronted through life_ a staid_ steadfast man_ whose life for the most part was a telling pantomime of action_ and not a tame chapter of sounds_ yet_ for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude_ there were certain qualities in him which at times affected_ and in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest_ uncommonly conscientious for a seaman_ and endued with a deep natural reverence_ the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline him to superstition_ but to that sort of superstition_ which in some organizations seems rather to spring_ somehow_ from intelligence than from ignorance_ outward portents and inward presentiments were his_ and if at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul_ much more did his far_away domestic memories of his young cape wife and child_ tend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature_ and open him still further to those latent influences which_ in some honest_hearted men_ restrain the gush of dare_devil daring_ so often evinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery_ _i will have no man in my boat__ said starbuck_ _who is not afraid of a whale__ by this_ he seemed to mean_ not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril_ but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward_ _aye_ aye__ said stubb_ the second mate_ _starbuck_ there_ is as careful a man as you_ll find anywhere in this fishery__ but we shall ere long see what that word _careful_ precisely means when used by a man like stubb_ or almost any other whale hunter_ starbuck was no crusader after perils_ in him courage was not a sentiment_ but a thing simply useful to him_ and always at hand upon all mortally practical occasions_ besides_ he thought_ perhaps_ that in this business of whaling_ courage was one of the great staple outfits of the ship_ like her beef and her bread_ and not to be foolishly wasted_ wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after sun_down_ nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting him_ for_ thought starbuck_ i am here in this critical ocean to kill whales for my living_ and not to be killed by them for theirs_ and that hundreds of men had been so killed starbuck well knew_ what doom was his own father_s_ where_ in the bottomless deeps_ could he find the torn limbs of his brother_ with memories like these in him_ and_ moreover_ given to a certain superstitiousness_ as has been said_ the courage of this starbuck which could_ nevertheless_ still flourish_ must indeed have been extreme_ but it was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized_ and with such terrible experiences and remembrances as he had_ it was not in nature that these things should fail in latently engendering an element in him_ which_ under suitable circumstances_ would break out from its confinement_ and burn all his courage up_ and brave as he might be_ it was that sort of bravery chiefly_ visible in some intrepid men_ which_ while generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas_ or winds_ or whales_ or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world_ yet cannot withstand those more terrific_ because more spiritual terrors_ which sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man_ but were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance_ the complete abasement of poor starbuck_s fortitude_ scarce might i have the heart to write it_ for it is a thing most sorrowful_ nay shocking_ to expose the fall of valour in the soul_ men may seem detestable as joint stock_companies and nations_ knaves_ fools_ and murderers there may be_ men may have mean and meagre faces_ but man_ in the ideal_ is so noble and so sparkling_ such a grand and glowing creature_ that over any ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their costliest robes_ that immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves_ so far within us_ that it remains intact though all the outer character seem gone_ bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a valor_ruined man_ nor can piety itself_ at such a shameful sight_ completely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars_ but this august dignity i treat of_ is not the dignity of kings and

and squires_ stubb was the second mate_ he was a native of cape cod_ and hence_ according to local usage_ was called a cape_cod_man_ a happy_go_lucky_ neither craven nor valiant_ taking perils as they came with an indifferent air_ and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the chase_ toiling away_ calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged for the year_ good_humored_ easy_ and careless_ he presided over his whale_boat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner_ and his crew all invited guests_ he was as particular about the comfortable arrangement of his part of the boat_ as an old stage_driver is about the snugness of his box_ when close to the whale_ in the very death_lock of the fight_ he handled his unpitying lance coolly and off_handedly_ as a whistling tinker his hammer_ he would hum over his old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the most exasperated monster_ long usage had_ for this stubb_ converted the jaws of death into an easy chair_ what he thought of death itself_ there is no telling_ whether he ever thought of it at all_ might be a question_ but_ if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a comfortable dinner_ no doubt_ like a good sailor_ he took it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft_ and bestir themselves there_ about something which he would find out when he obeyed the order_ and not sooner_ what_ perhaps_ with other things_ made stubb such an easy_going_ unfearing man_ so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a world full of grave pedlars_ all bowed to the ground with their packs_ what helped to bring about that almost impious good_humor of his_ that thing must have been his pipe_ for_ like his nose_ his short_ black little pipe was one of the regular features of his face_ you would almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without his nose as without his pipe_ he kept a whole row of pipes there ready loaded_ stuck in a rack_ within easy reach of his hand_ and_ whenever he turned in_ he smoked them all out in succession_ lighting one from the other to the end of the chapter_ then loading them again to be in readiness anew_ for_ when stubb dressed_ instead of first putting his legs into his trowsers_ he put his pipe into his mouth_ i say this continual smoking must have been one cause_ at least_ of his peculiar disposition_ for every one knows that this earthly air_ whether ashore or afloat_ is terribly infected with the nameless miseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it_ and as in time of the cholera_ some people go about with a camphorated handkerchief to their mouths_ so_ likewise_ against all mortal tribulations_ stubb_s tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort of disinfecting agent_ the third mate was flask_ a native of tisbury_ in martha_s vineyard_ a short_ stout_ ruddy young fellow_ very pugnacious concerning whales_ who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally and hereditarily affronted him_ and therefore it was a sort of point of honour with him_ to destroy them whenever encountered_ so utterly lost was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic bulk and mystic ways_ and so dead to anything like an apprehension of any possible danger from encountering them_ that in his poor opinion_ the wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse_ or at least water_rat_ requiring only a little circumvention and some small application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil_ this ignorant_ unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter of whales_ he followed these fish for the fun of it_ and a three years_ voyage round cape horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length of time_ as a carpenter_s nails are divided into wrought nails and cut nails_ so mankind may be similarly divided_ little flask was one of the wrought ones_ made to clinch tight and last long_ they called him king_post on board of the pequod_ because_ in form_ he could be well likened to the short_ square timber known by that name in arctic whalers_ and which by the means of many radiating side timbers inserted into it_ serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions of those battering seas_ now these three mates_starbuck_ stubb_ and flask_ were momentous men_ they it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the pequod_s boats as headsmen_ in that grand order of battle in which captain ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the whales_ these three headsmen were as captains of companies_ or_ being armed with their long keen whaling spears_ they were as a picked trio of lancers_ even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins_ and since in this famous fishery_ each mate or headsman_ like a gothic knight of old_ is always accompanied by his boat_steerer or harpooneer_ who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance_ when the former one has been badly twisted_ or elbowed in the assault_ and moreover_ as there generally subsists between the two_ a close intimacy and friendliness_ it is therefore but meet_ that in this place we set down who the pequod_s harpooneers were_ and to what headsman each of them belonged_ first of all was queequeg_ whom starbuck_ the chief mate_ had selected for his squire_ but queequeg is already known_ next was tashtego_ an unmixed indian from gay head_ the most westerly promontory of martha_s vineyard_ where there still exists the last remnant of a village of red men_ which has long supplied the neighboring island of nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneers_ in the fishery_ they usually go by the generic name of gay_headers_ tashtego_s long_ lean_ sable hair_ his high cheek bones_ and black rounding eyes_for an indian_ oriental in their largeness_ but antarctic in their glittering expression_all this sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunters_ who_ in quest of the great new england moose_ had scoured_ bow in hand_ the aboriginal forests of the main_ but no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland_ tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea_ the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of the sires_ to look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs_ you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of the earlier puritans_ and half_believed this wild indian to be a son of the prince of the powers of the air_ tashtego was stubb the second mate_s squire_ third among the harpooneers was daggoo_ a gigantic_ coal_black negro_savage_ with a lion_like tread_an ahasuerus to behold_ suspended from his ears were two golden hoops_ so large that the sailors called them ring_bolts_ and would talk of securing the top_sail halyards to them_ in his youth daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler_ lying in a lonely bay on his native coast_ and never having been anywhere in the world but in africa_ nantucket_ and the pagan harbors most frequented by whalemen_ and having now led for many years the bold life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of men they shipped_ daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues_ and erect as a giraffe_ moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in his socks_ there was a corporeal humility in looking up at him_ and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a fortress_ curious to tell_ this imperial negro_ ahasuerus daggoo_ was the squire of little flask_ who looked like a chess_man beside him_ as for the residue of the pequod_s company_ be it said_ that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men before the mast employed in the american whale fishery_ are americans born_ though pretty nearly all the officers are_ herein it is the same with the american whale fishery as with the american army and military and merchant navies_ and the engineering forces employed in the construction of the american canals and railroads_ the same_ i say_ because in all these cases the native american liberally provides the brains_ the rest of the world as generously supplying the muscles_ no small number of these whaling seamen belong to the azores_ where the outward bound nantucket whalers

seen to the contrary_ they seemed to be the only commanders of the ship_ only they sometimes issued from the cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory_ that after all it was plain they but commanded vicariously_ yes_ their supreme lord and dictator was there_ though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin_ every time i ascended to the deck from my watches below_ i instantly gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible_ for my first vague disquietude touching the unknown captain_ now in the seclusion of the sea_ became almost a perturbation_ this was strangely heightened at times by the ragged elijah_s diabolical incoherences uninvitedly recurring to me_ with a subtle energy i could not have before conceived of_ but poorly could i withstand them_ much as in other moods i was almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish prophet of the wharves_ but whatever it was of apprehensiveness or uneasiness_to call it so_which i felt_ yet whenever i came to look about me in the ship_ it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such emotions_ for though the harpooneers_ with the great body of the crew_ were a far more barbaric_ heathenish_ and motley set than any of the tame merchant_ship companies which my previous experiences had made me acquainted with_ still i ascribed this_and rightly ascribed it_to the fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild scandinavian vocation in which i had so abandonedly embarked_ but it was especially the aspect of the three chief officers of the ship_ the mates_ which was most forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings_ and induce confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage_ three better_ more likely sea_officers and men_ each in his own different way_ could not readily be found_ and they were every one of them americans_ a nantucketer_ a vineyarder_ a cape man_ now_ it being christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor_ for a space we had biting polar weather_ though all the time running away from it to the southward_ and by every degree and minute of latitude which we sailed_ gradually leaving that merciless winter_ and all its intolerable weather behind us_ it was one of those less lowering_ but still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the transition_ when with a fair wind the ship was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity_ that as i mounted to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch_ so soon as i levelled my glance towards the taffrail_ foreboding shivers ran over me_ reality outran apprehension_ captain ahab stood upon his quarter_deck_ there seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him_ nor of the recovery from any_ he looked like a man cut away from the stake_ when the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them_ or taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness_ his whole high_ broad form_ seemed made of solid bronze_ and shaped in an unalterable mould_ like cellini_s cast perseus_ threading its way out from among his grey hairs_ and continuing right down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck_ till it disappeared in his clothing_ you saw a slender rod_like mark_ lividly whitish_ it resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight_ lofty trunk of a great tree_ when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it_ and without wrenching a single twig_ peels and grooves out the bark from top to bottom_ ere running off into the soil_ leaving the tree still greenly alive_ but branded_ whether that mark was born with him_ or whether it was the scar left by some desperate wound_ no one could certainly say_ by some tacit consent_ throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to it_ especially by the mates_ but once tashtego_s senior_ an old gay_head indian among the crew_ superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old did ahab become that way branded_ and then it came upon him_ not in the fury of any mortal fray_ but in an elemental strife at sea_ yet_ this wild hint seemed inferentially negatived_ by what a grey manxman insinuated_ an old sepulchral man_ who_ having never before sailed out of nantucket_ had never ere this laid eye upon wild ahab_ nevertheless_ the old sea_traditions_ the immemorial credulities_ popularly invested this old manxman with preternatural powers of discernment_ so that no white sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever captain ahab should be tranquilly laid out_which might hardly come to pass_ so he muttered_then_ whoever should do that last office for the dead_ would find a birth_mark on him from crown to sole_ so powerfully did the whole grim aspect of ahab affect me_ and the livid brand which streaked it_ that for the first few moments i hardly noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood_ it had previously come to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished bone of the sperm whale_s jaw_ _aye_ he was dismasted off japan__ said the old gay_head indian once_ _but like his dismasted craft_ he shipped another mast without coming home for it_ he has a quiver of _em__ i was struck with the singular posture he maintained_ upon each side of the pequod_s quarter deck_ and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds_ there was an auger hole_ bored about half an inch or so_ into the plank_ his bone leg steadied in that hole_ one arm elevated_ and holding by a shroud_ captain ahab stood erect_ looking straight out beyond the ship_s ever_pitching prow_ there was an infinity of firmest fortitude_ a determinate_ unsurrenderable wilfulness_ in the fixed and fearless_ forward dedication of that glance_ not a word he spoke_ nor did his officers say aught to him_ though by all their minutest gestures and expressions_ they plainly showed the uneasy_ if not painful_ consciousness of being under a troubled master_eye_ and not only that_ but moody stricken ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face_ in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe_ ere long_ from his first visit in the air_ he withdrew into his cabin_ but after that morning_ he was every day visible to the crew_ either standing in his pivot_hole_ or seated upon an ivory stool he had_ or heavily walking the deck_ as the sky grew less gloomy_ indeed_ began to grow a little genial_ he became still less and less a recluse_ as if_ when the ship had sailed from home_ nothing but the dead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded_ and_ by and by_ it came to pass_ that he was almost continually in the air_ but_ as yet_ for all that he said_ or perceptibly did_ on the at last sunny deck_ he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast_ but the pequod was only making a passage now_ not regularly cruising_ nearly all whaling preparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to_ so that there was little or nothing_ out of himself_ to employ or excite ahab_ now_ and thus chase away_ for that one interval_ the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his brow_ as ever all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon_ nevertheless_ ere long_ the warm_ warbling persuasiveness of the pleasant_ holiday weather we came to_ seemed gradually to charm him from his mood_ for_ as when the red_cheeked_ dancing girls_ april and may_ trip home to the wintry_ misanthropic woods_ even the barest_ ruggedest_ most thunder_cloven old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts_ to welcome such glad_hearted visitants_ so ahab did_ in the end_ a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air_ more than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look_ which_ in any other man_ would have soon flowered out in a smile_ chapter ___ enter

but one of them was a real professional harpooneer and whaleman_ i mean captain scoresby_ on the separate subject of the greenland or right_whale_ he is the best existing authority_ but scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great sperm whale_ compared with which the greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning_ and here be it said_ that the greenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the seas_ he is not even by any means the largest of the whales_ yet_ owing to the long priority of his claims_ and the profound ignorance which_ till some seventy years back_ invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown sperm_whale_ and which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats and whale_ports_ this usurpation has been every way complete_ reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past days_ will satisfy you that the greenland whale_ without one rival_ was to them the monarch of the seas_ but the time has at last come for a new proclamation_ this is charing cross_ hear ye_ good people all__the greenland whale is deposed__the great sperm whale now reigneth_ there are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living sperm whale before you_ and at the same time_ in the remotest degree succeed in the attempt_ those books are beale_s and bennett_s_ both in their time surgeons to english south_sea whale_ships_ and both exact and reliable men_ the original matter touching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is necessarily small_ but so far as it goes_ it is of excellent quality_ though mostly confined to scientific description_ as yet_ however_ the sperm whale_ scientific or poetic_ lives not complete in any literature_ far above all other hunted whales_ his is an unwritten life_ now the various species of whales need some sort of popular comprehensive classification_ if only an easy outline one for the present_ hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent laborers_ as no better man advances to take this matter in hand_ i hereupon offer my own poor endeavors_ i promise nothing complete_ because any human thing supposed to be complete_ must for that very reason infallibly be faulty_ i shall not pretend to a minute anatomical description of the various species_ or_in this place at least_to much of any description_ my object here is simply to project the draught of a systematization of cetology_ i am the architect_ not the builder_ but it is a ponderous task_ no ordinary letter_sorter in the post_office is equal to it_ to grope down

through oceans_ i have had to do with whales with these visible hands_ i am in earnest_ and i will try_ there are some preliminaries to settle_ first_ the uncertain_ unsettled condition of this science of cetology is in the very vestibule attested by the fact_ that in some quarters it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish_ in his system of nature_ a_d_ _____ linnaeus declares_ _i hereby separate the whales from the fish__ but of my own knowledge_ i know that down to the year _____ sharks and shad_ alewives and herring_ against linnaeus_s express edict_ were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the leviathan_ the grounds upon which linnaeus would fain have banished the whales from the waters_ he states as follows_ _on account of their warm bilocular heart_ their lungs_ their movable eyelids_ their hollow ears_ penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem__ and finally_ _ex lege naturae jure meritoque__ i submitted all this to my friends simeon macey and charley coffin_ of nantucket_ both messmates of mine in a certain voyage_ and they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether insufficient_ charley profanely hinted they were humbug_ be it known that_ waiving all argument_ i take the good old fashioned ground that the whale is a fish_ and call upon holy jonah to back me_ this fundamental thing settled_ the next point is_ in what internal respect does the whale differ from other fish_ above_ linnaeus has given you those items_ but in brief_ they are these_ lungs and warm blood_ whereas_ all other fish are lungless and cold blooded_ next_ how shall we define the whale_ by his obvious externals_ so as conspicuously to label him for all time to come_ to be short_ then_ a whale is a spouting fish with a horizontal tail_ there you have him_ however contracted_ that definition is the result of expanded meditation_ a walrus spouts much like a whale_ but the walrus is not a fish_ because he is amphibious_ but the last term of the definition is still more cogent_ as coupled with the first_ almost any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat_ but a vertical_ or up_and_down tail_ whereas_ among spouting fish the tail_ though it may be similarly shaped_ invariably assumes a horizontal position_ by the above definition of what a whale is_ i do by no means exclude from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the whale by the best informed nantucketers_ nor_ on the other hand_ link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien__ hence_ all the smaller_ spouting_ and horizontal tailed fish must be included in this ground_plan of cetology_ now_ then_ come the grand divisions of the entire whale host_ _i am aware that down to the present time_ the fish styled lamatins and dugongs _pig_fish and sow_fish of the coffins of nantucket_ are included by many naturalists among the whales_ but as these pig_fish are a noisy_ contemptible set_ mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers_ and feeding on wet hay_ and especially as they do not spout_ i deny their credentials as whales_ and have presented them with their passports to quit the kingdom of cetology_ first_ according to magnitude i divide the whales into three primary books _subdivisible into chapters__ and these shall comprehend them all_ both small and large_ i_ the folio whale_ ii_ the octavo whale_ iii_ the duodecimo whale_ as the type of the folio i present the sperm whale_ of the octavo_ the grampus_ of the duodecimo_

sulphur_bottom whale_ book i_ _folio__ chapter i_ _sperm whale___this whale_ among the english of old vaguely known as the trumpa whale_ and the physeter whale_ and the anvil headed whale_ is the present cachalot of the french_ and the pottsfich of the germans_ and the macrocephalus of the long words_ he is_ without doubt_ the largest inhabitant of the globe_ the most formidable of all whales to encounter_ the most majestic in aspect_ and lastly_ by far the most valuable in commerce_ he being the only creature from which that valuable substance_ spermaceti_ is obtained_ all his peculiarities will_ in many other places_ be enlarged upon_ it is chiefly with his name that i now have to do_ philologically considered_ it is absurd_ some centuries ago_ when the sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality_ and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish_ in those days spermaceti_ it would seem_ was popularly supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known in england as the greenland or right whale_ it was the idea also_ that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of the greenland whale which the first syllable of the word literally expresses_ in those times_ also_ spermaceti was exceedingly scarce_ not being used for light_ but only as an ointment and medicament_ it was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb_ when_ as i opine_ in the course of time_ the true nature of spermaceti became known_ its original name was still retained by the dealers_ no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity_ and so the appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti was really derived_ book i_ _folio__ chapter ii_ _right whale___in one respect this is the most venerable of the leviathans_ being the one first regularly hunted by man_ it yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen_ and the oil specially known as _whale oil__ an inferior article in commerce_ among the fishermen_ he is indiscriminately designated by all the following titles_ the whale_ the greenland whale_ the black whale_ the great whale_ the true whale_ the right whale_ there is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus multitudinously baptised_ what then is the whale_ which i include in the second species of my folios_ it is the great mysticetus of the english naturalists_ the greenland whale of the english whalemen_ the baleine ordinaire of the french whalemen_ the growlands walfish of the swedes_ it is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been hunted by the dutch and english in the arctic seas_ it is the whale which the american fishermen have long pursued in the indian ocean_ on the brazil banks_ on the nor_ west coast_ and various other parts of the world_ designated by them right whale cruising grounds_ some pretend to see a difference between the greenland whale of the english and the right whale of the americans_ but they precisely agree in all their grand features_ nor has there yet been presented a single determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction_ it is by endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences_ that some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate_ the right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length_ with reference to elucidating the sperm whale_ book i_ _folio__ chapter iii_ _fin_back___under this head i reckon a monster which_ by the various names of fin_back_ tall_spout_ and long_john_ has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the atlantic_ in the new york packet_tracks_ in the length he attains_ and in his baleen_ the fin_back resembles the right whale_ but is of a less portly girth_ and a lighter colour_ approaching to olive_ his great lips present a cable_like aspect_ formed by the intertwisting_ slanting folds of large wrinkles_ his grand distinguishing feature_ the fin_ from which he derives his name_ is often a conspicuous object_ this fin is some three or four feet long_ growing vertically from the hinder part of the back_ of an angular shape_ and with a very sharp pointed end_ even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible_ this isolated fin will_ at times_ be seen plainly projecting from the surface_ when the sea is moderately calm_ and slightly marked with spherical ripples_ and this gnomon_like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled surface_ it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial_ with its style and wavy hour_lines graved on it_ on that ahaz_dial the shadow often goes back_ the fin_back is not gregarious_ he seems a whale_hater_ as some men are man_haters_ very shy_ always going solitary_ unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters_ his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain_ gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in swimming_ as to defy all present pursuit from man_ this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable cain of his race_ bearing for his mark that style upon his back_ from having the baleen in his mouth_ the fin_back is sometimes included with the right whale_ among a theoretic species denominated whalebone whales_ that is_ whales with baleen_ of these so called whalebone whales_ there would seem to be several varieties_ most of which_ however_ are little known_ broad_nosed whales and beaked whales_ pike_headed whales_ bunched whales_ under_jawed whales and rostrated whales_ are the fishermen_s names for a few sorts_ in connection with this appellative of _whalebone whales__ it is of great importance to mention_ that however such a nomenclature may be convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales_ yet it is in vain to attempt a clear classification of the leviathan_ founded upon either his baleen_ or hump_ or fin_ or teeth_ notwithstanding that those marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions_ which the whale_ in his kinds_ presents_ how then_ the baleen_ hump_ back_fin_ and teeth_ these are things whose peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales_ without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other and more essential particulars_ thus_ the sperm whale and the humpbacked whale_ each has a hump_ but there the similitude ceases_ then_ this same humpbacked whale and the greenland whale_ each of these has baleen_ but there again the similitude ceases_ and it is just the same with the other parts above mentioned_ in various sorts of whales_ they form such irregular combinations_ or_ in the case of any one of them detached_ such an irregular isolation_ as utterly to defy all general methodization formed upon such a basis_ on this rock every one of the whale_naturalists has split_ but it may possibly be conceived that_ in the internal parts of the whale_ in his anatomy_there_ at least_ we shall be able to hit the right classification_ nay_ what thing_ for example_ is there in the greenland whale_s anatomy more striking than his baleen_ yet we have seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the greenland whale_ and if you descend into the bowels of the various leviathans_ why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as available to the systematizer as those external ones already enumerated_ what then remains_ nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily_ in their entire liberal volume_ and boldly sort them that way_ and this is the bibliographical system here adopted_ and it is the only one that can possibly succeed_ for it alone is practicable_ to proceed_ book i_ _folio_ chapter iv_ _hump_back___this whale is often seen on the northern american coast_ he has been frequently captured there_ and towed into harbor_ he has a great pack on him like a peddler_ or you might call him the elephant and castle whale_ at any rate_ the popular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him_ since the sperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one_ his oil is not very valuable_ he has baleen_ he is the most gamesome and light_hearted of all the whales_ making more gay foam and white water generally than any other of them_ book i_ _folio__ chapter v_ _razor_back___of this whale little is known but his name_ i have seen him at a distance off cape horn_ of a retiring nature_ he eludes both hunters and philosophers_ though no coward_ he has never yet shown any part of him but his back_ which rises in a long sharp ridge_ let him go_ i know little more of him_ nor does anybody else_ book i_ _folio__ chapter vi_ _sulphur_bottom___another retiring gentleman_ with a brimstone belly_ doubtless got by scraping along the tartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings_ he is seldom seen_ at least i have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas_ and then always at too great a distance to study his countenance_ he is never chased_ he would run away with rope_walks of line_ prodigies are told of him_ adieu_ sulphur bottom_ i can say nothing more that is true of ye_ nor can the oldest nantucketer_ thus ends book i_ _folio__ and now begins book ii_ _octavo__ octavoes___these embrace the whales of middling magnitude_ among which present may be numbered__i__ the grampus_ ii__ the black fish_ iii__ the narwhale_ iv__ the thrasher_ v__ the killer_ _why this book of whales is not denominated the quarto is very plain_ because_ while the whales of this order_ though smaller than those of the former order_ nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them in figure_ yet the bookbinder_s quarto volume in its dimensioned form does not preserve the shape of the folio volume_ but the octavo volume does_ book ii_ _octavo__ chapter i_ _grampus___though this fish_ whose loud sonorous breathing_ or rather blowing_ has furnished a proverb to landsmen_ is so well known a denizen of the deep_ yet is he not popularly classed among whales_ but possessing all the grand distinctive features of the leviathan_ most naturalists have recognised him for one_ he is of moderate octavo size_ varying from fifteen to twenty_five feet in length_ and of corresponding dimensions round the waist_ he swims in herds_ he is never regularly hunted_ though his oil is considerable in quantity_ and pretty good for light_ by some fishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale_ book ii_ _octavo__ chapter ii_ _black fish___i give the popular fishermen_s names for all these fish_ for generally they are the best_ where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive_ i shall say so_ and suggest another_ i do so now_ touching the black fish_ so_called_ because blackness is the rule among almost all whales_ so_ call him the hyena whale_ if you please_ his voracity is well known_ and from the circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards_ he carries an everlasting mephistophelean grin on his face_ this whale averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length_ he is found in almost all latitudes_ he has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin in swimming_ which looks something like a roman nose_ when not more profitably employed_ the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the hyena whale_ to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employment_as some frugal housekeepers_ in the absence of company_ and quite alone by themselves_ burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax_ though their blubber is very thin_ some of these whales will yield you upwards of thirty gallons of oil_ book ii_ _octavo__ chapter iii_ _narwhale__ that is_ nostril whale__another instance of a curiously named whale_ so named i suppose from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose_ the creature is some sixteen feet in length_ while its horn averages five feet_ though some exceed ten_ and even attain to fifteen feet_ strictly speaking_ this horn is but a lengthened tusk_ growing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the horizontal_ but it is only found on the sinister side_ which has an ill effect_ giving its owner something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left_handed man_ what precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers_ it would be hard to say_ it does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword_fish and bill_fish_ though some sailors tell me that the narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food_ charley coffin said it was used for an ice_piercer_ for the narwhale_ rising to the surface of the polar sea_ and finding it sheeted with ice_ thrusts his horn up_ and so breaks through_ but you cannot prove either of these surmises to be correct_ my own opinion is_ that however this one_sided horn may really be used by the narwhale_however that may be_it would certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets_ the narwhale i have heard called the tusked whale_ the horned whale_ and the unicorn whale_ he is certainly a curious example of the unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature_ from certain cloistered old authors i have gathered that this same sea_unicorn_s horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote against poison_ and as such_ preparations of it brought immense prices_ it was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies_ the same way that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn_ originally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity_ black letter tells me that sir martin frobisher on his return from that voyage_ when queen bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window of greenwich palace_ as his bold ship sailed down the thames_ _when sir martin returned from that voyage__ saith black letter_ _on bended knees he presented to her highness a prodigious long horn of the narwhale_ which for a long period after hung in the castle at windsor__ an irish author avers that the earl of leicester_ on bended knees_ did likewise present to her highness another horn_ pertaining to a land beast of the unicorn nature_ the narwhale has a very picturesque_ leopard_like look_ being of a milk_white ground colour_ dotted with round and oblong spots of black_ his oil is very superior_ clear and fine_ but there is little of it_ and he is seldom hunted_ he is mostly found in the circumpolar seas_ book ii_ _octavo__ chapter iv_ _killer___of this whale little is precisely known to the nantucketer_ and nothing at all to the professed naturalist_ from what i have seen of him at a distance_ i should say that he was about the bigness of a grampus_ he is very savage_a sort of feegee fish_ he sometimes takes the great folio whales by the lip_ and hangs there like a leech_ till the mighty brute is worried to death_ the killer is never hunted_ i never heard what sort of oil he has_ exception might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale_ on the ground of its indistinctness_ for we are all killers_ on land and on sea_ bonapartes and sharks included_ book ii_ _octavo__ chapter v_ _thrasher___this gentleman is famous for his tail_ which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes_ he mounts the folio whale_s back_ and as he swims_ he works his passage by flogging him_ as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar process_ still less is known of the thrasher than of the killer_ both are outlaws_ even in the lawless seas_ thus ends book ii_ _octavo__ and begins book iii_ _duodecimo__ duodecimoes__these include the smaller whales_ i_ the huzza porpoise_ ii_ the algerine porpoise_ iii_ the mealy_mouthed porpoise_ to those who have not chanced specially to study the subject_ it may possibly seem strange_ that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five feet should be marshalled among whales_a word_ which_ in the popular sense_ always conveys an idea of hugeness_ but the creatures set down above as duodecimoes are infallibly whales_ by the terms of my definition of what a whale is_i_e_ a spouting fish_ with a horizontal tail_ book iii_ _duodecimo__ chapter __ _huzza porpoise___this is the common porpoise found almost all over the globe_ the name is of my own bestowal_ for there are more than one sort of porpoises_ and something must be done to distinguish them_ i call him thus_ because he always swims in hilarious shoals_ which upon the broad sea keep tossing themselves to heaven like caps in a fourth_of_july crowd_ their appearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner_ full of fine spirits_ they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward_ they are the lads that always live before the wind_ they are accounted a lucky omen_ if you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding these vivacious fish_ then heaven help ye_ the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye_ a well_fed_ plump huzza porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil_ but the fine and delicate fluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable_ it is in request among jewellers and watchmakers_ sailors put it on their hones_ porpoise meat is good eating_ you know_ it may never have occurred to you that a porpoise spouts_ indeed_ his spout is so small that it is not very readily discernible_ but the next time you have a chance_ watch him_ and you will then see the great sperm whale himself in miniature_ book iii_ _duodecimo__ chapter ii_ _algerine porpoise___a pirate_ very savage_ he is only found_ i think_ in the pacific_ he is somewhat larger than the huzza porpoise_ but much of the same general make_ provoke him_ and he will buckle to a shark_ i have lowered for him many times_ but never yet saw him captured_ book iii_ _duodecimo__ chapter iii_ _mealy_mouthed porpoise___the largest kind of porpoise_ and only found in the pacific_ so far as it is known_ the only english name_ by which he has hitherto been designated_ is that of the fishers_right_whale porpoise_ from the circumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that folio_ in shape_ he differs in some degree from the huzza porpoise_ being of a less rotund and jolly girth_ indeed_ he is of quite a neat and gentleman_like figure_ he has no fins on his back _most other porpoises have__ he has a lovely tail_ and sentimental indian eyes of a hazel hue_ but his mealy_mouth spoils all_ though his entire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable_ yet a boundary line_ distinct as the mark in a ship_s hull_ called the _bright waist__ that line streaks him from stem to stern_ with two separate colours_ black above and white below_ the white comprises part of his head_ and the whole of his mouth_ which makes him look as if he had just escaped from a felonious visit to a meal_bag_ a most mean and mealy aspect_ his oil is much like that of the common porpoise_ beyond the duodecimo_ this system does not proceed_ inasmuch as the porpoise is the smallest of the whales_ above_ you have all the leviathans of note_ but there are a rabble of uncertain_ fugitive_ half_fabulous whales_ which_ as an american whaleman_ i know by reputation_ but not personally_ i shall enumerate them by their fore_castle appellations_ for possibly such a list may be valuable to future investigators_ who may complete what i have here but begun_ if any of the following whales_ shall hereafter be caught and marked_ then he can readily be incorporated into this system_ according to his folio_ octavo_ or duodecimo magnitude__the bottle_nose whale_ the junk whale_ the pudding_headed whale_ the cape whale_ the leading whale_ the cannon whale_ the scragg whale_ the coppered whale_ the elephant whale_ the iceberg whale_ the quog whale_ the blue whale_ etc_ from icelandic_ dutch_ and old english authorities_ there might be quoted other lists of uncertain whales_ blessed with all manner of uncouth names_ but i omit them as altogether obsolete_ and can hardly help suspecting them for mere sounds_ full of leviathanism_ but signifying nothing_ finally_ it was stated at the outset_ that this system would not be here_ and at once_ perfected_ you cannot but plainly see that i have kept my word_ but i now leave my cetological system standing thus unfinished_ even as the great cathedral of cologne was left_ with the crane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower_ for small erections may be finished by their first architects_ grand ones_ true ones_ ever leave the copestone to posterity_ god keep me from ever completing anything_ this whole book is but a draught_nay_ but the draught of a draught_ oh_ time_ strength_ cash_ and patience_ chapter ___ the specksnyder_ concerning the officers of the whale_craft_ this seems as good a place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship_board_ arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers_ a class unknown of course in any other marine than the whale_fleet_ the large importance attached to the harpooneer_s vocation is evinced by the fact_ that originally in the old dutch fishery_ two centuries and more ago_ the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the person now called the captain_ but was divided between him and an officer called the specksnyder_ literally this word means fat_cutter_ usage_ however_ in time made it equivalent to chief harpooneer_ in those days_ the captain_s authority was restricted to the navigation and general management of the vessel_ while over the whale_hunting department and all its concerns_ the specksnyder or chief harpooneer reigned supreme_ in the british greenland fishery_ under the corrupted title of specksioneer_ this old dutch official is still retained_ but his former dignity is sadly abridged_ at present he ranks simply as senior harpooneer_ and as such_ is but one of the captain_s more inferior subalterns_ nevertheless_ as upon the good conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends_ and since in the american fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat_ but under certain circumstances _night watches on a whaling ground_ the command of the ship_s deck is also his_ therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands_ that he should nominally live apart from the men before the mast_ and be in some way distinguished as their professional superior_ though always_ by them_ familiarly regarded as their social equal_ now_ the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea_ is this_the first lives aft_ the last forward_ hence_ in whale_ships and merchantmen alike_ the mates have their quarters with the captain_ and so_ too_ in most of the american whalers the harpooneers are lodged in the after part of the ship_ that is to say_ they take their meals in the captain_s cabin_ and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with it_ though the long period of a southern whaling voyage _by far the longest of all voyages now or ever made by man__ the peculiar perils of it_ and the community of interest prevailing among a company_ all of whom_ high or low_ depend for their profits_ not upon fixed wages_ but upon their common luck_ together with their common vigilance_ intrepidity_ and hard work_ though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a less rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally_ yet_ never mind how much like an old mesopotamian family these whalemen may_ in some primitive instances_ live together_ for all that_ the punctilious externals_ at least_ of the quarter_deck are seldom materially relaxed_ and in no instance done away_ indeed_ many are the nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper parading his quarter_deck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in any military navy_ nay_ extorting almost as much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple_ and not the shabbiest of pilot_cloth_ and though of all men the moody captain of the pequod was the least given to that sort of shallowest assumption_ and though the only homage he ever exacted_ was implicit_ instantaneous obedience_ though he required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the quarter_deck_ and though there were times when_ owing to peculiar circumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed_ he addressed them in unusual terms_ whether of condescension or in terrorem_ or otherwise_ yet even captain ahab was by no means unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea_ nor_ perhaps_ will it fail to be eventually perceived_ that behind those forms and usages_ as it were_ he sometimes masked himself_ incidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than they were legitimately intended to subserve_ that certain sultanism of his brain_ which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested_ through those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship_ for be a man_s intellectual superiority what it will_ it can never assume the practical_ available supremacy over other men_ without the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments_ always_ in themselves_ more or less paltry and base_ this it is_ that for ever keeps god_s true princes of the empire from the world_s hustings_ and leaves the highest honours that this air can give_ to those men who become famous more through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful of the divine inert_ than through their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass_ such large virtue lurks in these small things when extreme political superstitions invest them_ that in some royal instances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted potency_ but when_ as in the case of nicholas the czar_ the ringed crown of geographical empire encircles an imperial brain_ then_ the plebeian herds crouch abased before the tremendous centralization_ nor_ will the tragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing_ ever forget a hint_ incidentally so important in his art_ as the one now alluded to_ but ahab_ my captain_ still moves before me in all his nantucket grimness and shagginess_ and in this episode touching emperors and kings_ i must not conceal that i have only to do with a poor old whale_hunter like him_ and_ therefore_ all outward majestical trappings and housings are denied me_ oh_ ahab_ what shall be grand in thee_ it must needs be plucked at from the skies_ and dived for in the deep_ and featured in the unbodied air_ chapter ___ the cabin_table_ it is noon_ and dough_boy_ the steward_ thrusting his pale loaf_of_bread face from the cabin_scuttle_ announces dinner to his lord and master_ who_ sitting in the lee quarter_boat_ has just been taking an observation of the sun_ and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the smooth_ medallion_shaped tablet_ reserved for that daily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg_ from his complete inattention to the tidings_ you would think that moody ahab had not heard his menial_ but presently_ catching hold of the mizen shrouds_ he swings himself to the deck_ and in an even_ unexhilarated voice_ saying_ _dinner_ mr_ starbuck__ disappears into the cabin_ when the last echo of his sultan_s step has died away_ and starbuck_ the first emir_ has every reason to suppose that he is seated_ then starbuck rouses from his quietude_ takes a few turns along the planks_ and_ after a grave peep into the binnacle_ says_ with some touch of pleasantness_ _dinner_ mr_ stubb__ and descends the scuttle_ the second emir lounges about the rigging awhile_ and then slightly shaking the main brace_ to see whether it will be all right with that important rope_ he likewise takes up the old burden_ and with a rapid _dinner_ mr_ flask__ follows after his predecessors_ but the third emir_ now seeing himself all alone on the quarter_deck_ seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint_ for_ tipping all sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions_ and kicking off his shoes_ he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right over the grand turk_s head_ and then_ by a dexterous sleight_ pitching his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf_ he goes down rollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the deck_ reversing all other processions_ by bringing up the rear with music_ but ere stepping into the cabin doorway below_ he pauses_ ships a new face altogether_ and_ then_ independent_ hilarious little flask enters king ahab_s presence_ in the character of abjectus_ or the slave_ it is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense artificialness of sea_usages_ that while in the open air of the deck some officers will_ upon provocation_ bear themselves boldly and defyingly enough towards their commander_ yet_ ten to one_ let those very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that same commander_s cabin_ and straightway their inoffensive_ not to say deprecatory and humble air towards him_ as he sits at the head of the table_ this is marvellous_ sometimes most comical_ wherefore this difference_ a problem_ perhaps not_ to have been belshazzar_ king of babylon_ and to have been belshazzar_ not haughtily but courteously_ therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur_ but he who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own private dinner_table of invited guests_ that man_s unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence for the time_ that man_s royalty of state transcends belshazzar_s_ for belshazzar was not the greatest_ who has but once dined his friends_ has tasted what it is to be caesar_ it is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding_ now_ if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a ship_master_ then_ by inference_ you will derive the cause of that peculiarity of sea_life just mentioned_ over his ivory_inlaid table_ ahab presided like a mute_ maned sea_lion on the white coral beach_ surrounded by his warlike but still deferential cubs_ in his own proper turn_ each officer waited to be served_ they were as little children before ahab_ and yet_ in ahab_ there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance_ with one mind_ their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man_s knife_ as he carved the chief dish before him_ i do not suppose that for the world they would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation_ even upon so neutral a topic as the weather_ no_ and when reaching out his knife and fork_ between which the slice of beef was locked_ ahab thereby motioned starbuck_s plate towards him_ the mate received his meat as though receiving alms_ and cut it tenderly_ and a little started if_ perchance_ the knife grazed against the plate_ and chewed it noiselessly_ and swallowed it_ not without circumspection_ for_ like the coronation banquet at frankfort_ where the german emperor profoundly dines with the seven imperial electors_ so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals_ eaten in awful silence_ and yet at table old ahab forbade not conversation_ only he himself was dumb_ what a relief it was to choking stubb_ when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below_ and poor little flask_ he was the youngest son_ and little boy of this weary family party_ his were the shinbones of the saline beef_ his would have been the drumsticks_ for flask to have presumed to help himself_ this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first degree_ had he helped himself at that table_ doubtless_ never more would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world_ nevertheless_ strange to say_ ahab never forbade him_ and had flask helped himself_ the chances were ahab had never so much as noticed it_ least of all_ did flask presume to help himself to butter_ whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him_ on account of its clotting his clear_ sunny complexion_ or whether he deemed that_ on so long a voyage in such marketless waters_ butter was at a premium_ and therefore was not for him_ a subaltern_ however it was_ flask_ alas_ was a butterless man_ another thing_ flask was the last person down at the dinner_ and flask is the first man up_ consider_ for hereby flask_s dinner was badly jammed in point of time_ starbuck and stubb both had the start of him_ and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear_ if stubb even_ who is but a peg higher than flask_ happens to have but a small appetite_ and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast_ then flask must bestir himself_ he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day_ for it is against holy usage for stubb to precede flask to the deck_ therefore it was that flask once admitted in private_ that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an officer_ from that moment he had never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry_ more or less_ for what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger_ as keep it immortal in him_ peace and satisfaction_ thought flask_ have for ever departed from my stomach_ i am an officer_ but_ how i wish i could fish a bit of old_fashioned beef in the forecastle_ as i used to when i was before the mast_ there_s the fruits of promotion now_ there_s the vanity of glory_ there_s the insanity of life_ besides_ if it were so that any mere sailor of the pequod had a grudge against flask in flask_s official capacity_ all that sailor had to do_ in order to obtain ample vengeance_ was to go aft at dinner_time_ and get a peep at flask through the cabin sky_light_ sitting silly and dumfoundered before awful ahab_ now_ ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table in the pequod_s cabin_ after their departure_ taking place in inverted order to their arrival_ the canvas cloth was cleared_ or rather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward_ and then the three harpooneers were bidden to the feast_ they being its residuary legatees_ they made a sort of temporary servants_ hall of the high and mighty cabin_ in strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless invisible domineerings of the captain_s table_ was the entire care_free license and ease_ the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows the harpooneers_ while their masters_ the mates_ seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws_ the harpooneers chewed their food with such a relish that there was a report to it_ they dined like lords_ they filled their bellies like indian ships all day loading with spices_ such portentous appetites had queequeg and tashtego_ that to fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast_ often the pale dough_boy was fain to bring on a great baron of salt_junk_ seemingly quarried out of the solid ox_ and if he were not lively about it_ if he did not go with a nimble hop_skip_and_jump_ then tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back_ harpoon_wise_ and once daggoo_ seized with a sudden humor_ assisted dough_boy_s memory by snatching him up bodily_ and thrusting his head into a great empty wooden trencher_ while tashtego_ knife in hand_ began laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him_ he was naturally a very nervous_ shuddering sort of little fellow_ this bread_faced steward_ the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse_ and what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific ahab_ and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages_ dough_boy_s whole life was one continual lip_quiver_ commonly_ after seeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded_ he would escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining_ and fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door_ till all was over_ it was a sight to see queequeg seated over against tashtego_ opposing his filed teeth to the indian_s_ crosswise to them_ daggoo seated on the floor_ for a bench would have brought his hearse_plumed head to the low carlines_ at every motion of his colossal limbs_ making the low cabin framework to shake_ as when an african elephant goes passenger in a ship_ but for all this_ the great negro was wonderfully abstemious_ not to say dainty_ it seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad_ baronial_ and superb a person_ but_ doubtless_ this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air_ and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds_ not by beef or by bread_ are giants made or nourished_ but queequeg_ he had a mortal_ barbaric smack of the lip in eating_an ugly sound enough_so much so_ that the trembling dough_boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms_ and when he would hear tashtego singing out for him to produce himself_ that his bones might be picked_ the simple_witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging round him in the pantry_ by his sudden fits of the palsy_ nor did the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets_ for their lances and other weapons_ and with which whetstones_ at dinner_ they would ostentatiously sharpen their knives_ that grating sound did not at all tend to tranquillize poor dough_boy_ how could he forget that in his island days_ queequeg_ for one_ must certainly have been guilty of some murderous_ convivial indiscretions_ alas_ dough_boy_ hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals_ not a napkin should he carry on his arm_ but a buckler_ in good time_ though_ to his great delight_ the three salt_sea warriors would rise and depart_ to his credulous_ fable_mongering ears_ all their martial bones jingling in them at every step_ like moorish scimetars in scabbards_ but_ though these barbarians dined in the cabin_ and nominally lived there_ still_ being anything but sedentary in their habits_ they were scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes_ and just before sleeping_time_ when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters_ in this one matter_ ahab seemed no exception to most american whale captains_ who_ as a set_ rather incline to the opinion that by rights the ship_s cabin belongs to them_ and that it is by courtesy alone that anybody else is_ at any time_ permitted there_ so that_ in real truth_ the mates and harpooneers of the pequod might more properly be said to have lived out of the cabin than in it_ for when they did enter it_ it was something as a street_door enters a house_ turning inwards for a moment_ only to be turned out the next_ and_ as a permanent thing_ residing in the open air_ nor did they lose much hereby_ in the cabin was no companionship_ socially_ ahab was inaccessible_ though nominally included in the census of christendom_ he was still an alien to it_ he lived in the world_ as the last of the grisly bears lived in settled missouri_ and as when spring and summer had departed_ that wild logan of the woods_ burying himself in the hollow of a tree_ lived out the winter there_ sucking his own paws_ so_ in his inclement_ howling old age_ ahab_s soul_ shut up in the caved trunk of his body_ there fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom_ chapter ___ the mast_head_ it was during the more pleasant weather_ that in due rotation with the other seamen my first mast_head came round_ in most american whalemen the mast_heads are manned almost simultaneously with the vessel_s leaving her port_ even though she may have fifteen thousand miles_ and more_ to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground_ and if_ after a three_ four_ or five years_ voyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her_say_ an empty vial even_then_ her mast_heads are kept manned to the last_ and not till her skysail_poles sail in among the spires of the port_ does she altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more_ now_ as the business of standing mast_heads_ ashore or afloat_ is a very ancient and interesting one_ let us in some measure expatiate here_ i take it_ that the earliest standers of mast_heads were the old egyptians_ because_ in all my researches_ i find none prior to them_ for though their progenitors_ the builders of babel_ must doubtless_ by their tower_ have intended to rear the loftiest mast_head in all asia_ or africa either_ yet _ere the final truck was put to it_ as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board_ in the dread gale of god_s wrath_ therefore_ we cannot give these babel builders priority over the egyptians_ and that the egyptians were a nation of mast_head standers_ is an assertion based upon the general belief among archaeologists_ that the first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes_ a theory singularly supported by the peculiar stair_like formation of all four sides of those edifices_ whereby_ with prodigious long upliftings of their legs_ those old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex_ and sing out for new stars_ even as the look_outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail_ or a whale just bearing in sight_ in saint stylites_ the famous christian hermit of old times_ who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life on its summit_ hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle_ in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless stander_of_mast_heads_ who was not to be driven from his place by fogs or frosts_ rain_ hail_ or sleet_ but valiantly facing everything out to the last_ literally died at his post_ of modern standers_of_mast_heads we have but a lifeless set_ mere stone_ iron_ and bronze men_ who_ though well capable of facing out a stiff gale_ are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any strange sight_ there is napoleon_ who_ upon the top of the column of vendome_ stands with arms folded_ some one hundred and fifty feet in the air_ careless_ now_ who rules the decks below_ whether louis philippe_ louis blanc_ or louis the devil_ great washington_ too_ stands high aloft on his towering main_mast in baltimore_ and like one of hercules_ pillars_ his column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go_ admiral nelson_ also_ on a capstan of gun_metal_ stands his mast_head in trafalgar square_ and ever when most obscured by that london smoke_ token is yet given that a hidden hero is there_ for where there is smoke_ must be fire_ but neither great washington_ nor napoleon_ nor nelson_ will answer a single hail from below_ however madly invoked to befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze_ however it may be surmised_ that their spirits penetrate through the thick haze of the future_ and descry what shoals and what rocks must be shunned_ it may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast_head standers of the land with those of the sea_ but that in truth it is not so_ is plainly evinced by an item for which obed macy_ the sole historian of nantucket_ stands accountable_ the worthy obed tells us_ that in the early times of the whale fishery_ ere ships were regularly launched in pursuit of the game_ the people of that island erected lofty spars along the sea_coast_ to which the look_outs ascended by means of nailed cleats_ something as fowls go upstairs in a hen_house_ a few years ago this same plan was adopted by the bay whalemen of new zealand_ who_ upon descrying the game_ gave notice to the ready_manned boats nigh the beach_ but this custom has now become obsolete_ turn we then to the one proper mast_head_ that of a whale_ship at sea_ the three mast_heads are kept manned from sun_rise to sun_set_ the seamen taking their regular turns _as at the helm__ and relieving each other every two hours_ in the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast_head_ nay_ to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful_ there you stand_ a hundred feet above the silent decks_ striding along the deep_ as if the masts were gigantic stilts_ while beneath you and between your legs_ as it were_ swim the hugest monsters of the sea_ even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous colossus at old rhodes_ there you stand_ lost in the infinite series of the sea_ with nothing ruffled but the waves_ the tranced ship indolently rolls_ the drowsy trade winds blow_ everything resolves you into languor_ for the most part_ in this tropic whaling life_ a sublime uneventfulness invests you_ you hear no news_ read no gazettes_ extras with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary excitements_ you hear of no domestic afflictions_ bankrupt securities_ fall of stocks_ are never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for dinner_for all your meals for three years and more are snugly stowed in casks_ and your bill of fare is immutable_ in one of those southern whalesmen_ on a long three or four years_ voyage_ as often happens_ the sum of the various hours you spend at the mast_head would amount to several entire months_ and it is much to be deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term of your natural life_ should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness_ or adapted to breed a comfortable localness of feeling_ such as pertains to a bed_ a hammock_ a hearse_ a sentry box_ a pulpit_ a coach_ or any other of those small and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves_ your most usual point of perch is the head of the t_ gallant_mast_ where you stand upon two thin parallel sticks _almost peculiar to whalemen_ called the t_ gallant cross_trees_ here_ tossed about by the sea_ the beginner feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bull_s horns_ to be sure_ in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you_ in the shape of a watch_coat_ but properly speaking the thickest watch_coat is no more of a house than the unclad body_ for as the soul is glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle_ and cannot freely move about in it_ nor even move out of it_ without running great risk of perishing _like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy alps in winter__ so a watch_coat is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope_ or additional skin encasing you_ you cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in your body_ and no more can you make a convenient closet of your watch_coat_ concerning all this_ it is much to be deplored that the mast_heads of a southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or pulpits_ called crow_s_nests_ in which the look_outs of a greenland whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas_ in the fireside narrative of captain sleet_ entitled _a voyage among the icebergs_ in quest of the greenland whale_ and incidentally for the re_discovery of the lost icelandic colonies of old greenland__ in this admirable volume_ all standers of mast_heads are furnished with a charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented crow_s_nest of the glacier_ which was the name of captain sleet_s good craft_ he called it the sleet_s crow_s_nest_ in honour of himself_ he being the original inventor and patentee_ and free from all ridiculous false delicacy_ and holding that if we call our own children after our own names _we fathers being the original inventors and patentees__ so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we may beget_ in shape_ the sleet_s crow_s_nest is something like a large tierce or pipe_ it is open above_ however_ where it is furnished with a movable side_screen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale_ being fixed on the summit of the mast_ you ascend into it through a little trap_hatch in the bottom_ on the after side_ or side next the stern of the ship_ is a comfortable seat_ with a locker underneath for umbrellas_ comforters_ and coats_ in front is a leather rack_ in which to keep your speaking trumpet_ pipe_ telescope_ and other nautical conveniences_ when captain sleet in person stood his mast_head in this crow_s_nest of his_ he tells us that he always had a rifle with him _also fixed in the rack__ together with a powder flask and shot_ for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales_ or vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters_ for you cannot successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the water_ but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing_ now_ it was plainly a labor of love for captain sleet to describe_ as he does_ all the little detailed conveniences of his crow_s_nest_ but though he so enlarges upon many of these_ and though he treats us to a very scientific account of his experiments in this crow_s_nest_ with a small compass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is called the _local attraction_ of all binnacle magnets_ an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship_s planks_ and in the glacier_s case_ perhaps_ to there having been so many broken_down blacksmiths among her crew_ i say_ that though the captain is very discreet and scientific here_ yet_ for all his learned _binnacle deviations__ _azimuth compass observations__ and _approximate errors__ he knows very well_ captain sleet_ that he was not so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations_ as to fail being attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little case_bottle_ so nicely tucked in on one side of his crow_s nest_ within easy reach of his hand_ though_ upon the whole_ i greatly admire and even love the brave_ the honest_ and learned captain_ yet i take it very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that case_bottle_ seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been_ while with mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the mathematics aloft there in that bird_s nest within three or four perches of the pole_ but if we southern whale_fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as captain sleet and his greenlandmen were_ yet that disadvantage is greatly counter_balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those seductive seas in which we south fishers mostly float_ for one_ i used to lounge up the rigging very leisurely_ resting in the top to have a chat with queequeg_ or any one else off duty whom i might find there_ then ascending a little way further_ and throwing a lazy leg over the top_sail yard_ take a preliminary view of the watery pastures_ and so at last mount to my ultimate destination_ let me make a clean breast of it here_ and frankly admit that i kept but sorry guard_ with the problem of the universe revolving in me_ how could i_being left completely to myself at such a thought_engendering altitude_how could i but lightly hold my obligations to observe all whale_ships_ standing orders_ _keep your weather eye open_ and sing out every time__ and let me in this place movingly admonish you_ ye ship_owners of nantucket_ beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with lean brow and hollow eye_ given to unseasonable meditativeness_ and who offers to ship with the phaedon instead of bowditch in his head_ beware of such an one_ i say_ your whales must be seen before they can be killed_ and this sunken_eyed young platonist will tow you ten wakes round the world_ and never make you one pint of sperm the richer_ nor are these monitions at all unneeded_ for nowadays_ the whale_fishery furnishes an asylum for many romantic_ melancholy_ and absent_minded young men_ disgusted with the carking cares of earth_ and seeking sentiment in tar and blubber_ childe harold not unfrequently perches himself upon the mast_head of some luckless disappointed whale_ship_ and in moody phrase ejaculates__ _roll on_ thou deep and dark blue ocean_ roll_ ten thousand blubber_hunters sweep over thee in vain__ very often do the captains of such ships take those absent_minded young philosophers to task_ upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient _interest_ in the voyage_ half_hinting that they are so hopelessly lost to all honourable ambition_ as that in their secret souls they would rather not see whales than otherwise_ but all in vain_ those young platonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect_ they are short_sighted_ what use_ then_ to strain the visual nerve_ they have left their opera_glasses at home_ _why_ thou monkey__ said a harpooneer to one of these lads_ _we_ve been cruising now hard upon three years_ and thou hast not raised a whale yet_ whales are scarce as hen_s

breakfast_ ahab_ as was his wont_ ascended the cabin_gangway to the deck_ there most sea_captains usually walk at that hour_ as country gentlemen_ after the same meal_ take a few turns in the garden_ soon his steady_ ivory stride was heard_ as to and fro he paced his old rounds_ upon planks so familiar to his tread_ that they were all over dented_ like geological stones_ with the peculiar mark of his walk_ did you fixedly gaze_ too_ upon that ribbed and dented brow_ there also_ you would see still stranger foot_prints_the foot_prints of his one unsleeping_ ever_pacing thought_ but on the occasion in question_ those dents looked deeper_ even as his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark_ and_ so full of his thought was ahab_ that at every uniform turn that he made_ now at the main_mast and now at the binnacle_ you could almost see that thought turn in him as he turned_ and pace in him as he paced_ so completely possessing him_ indeed_ that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer movement_ _d_ye mark him_ flask__ whispered stubb_ _the chick that_s in him pecks the shell_ _twill soon be out__ the hours wore on__ahab now shut up within his cabin_ anon_ pacing the deck_ with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect_ it drew near the close of day_ suddenly he came to a halt by the bulwarks_ and inserting his bone leg into the auger_hole there_ and with one hand grasping a shroud_ he ordered starbuck to send everybody aft_ _sir__ said the mate_ astonished at an order seldom or never given on ship_board except in some extraordinary case_ _send everybody aft__ repeated ahab_ _mast_heads_ there_ come down__ when the entire ship_s company were assembled_ and with curious and not wholly unapprehensive faces_ were eyeing him_ for he looked not unlike the weather horizon when a storm is coming up_ ahab_ after rapidly glancing over the bulwarks_ and then darting his eyes among the crew_ started from his standpoint_ and as though not a soul were nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck_ with bent head and half_slouched hat he continued to pace_ unmindful of the wondering whispering among the men_ till stubb cautiously whispered to flask_ that ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat_ but this did not last long_ vehemently pausing_ he cried__ _what do ye do when ye see a whale_ men__ _sing out for him__ was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed voices_ _good__ cried ahab_ with a wild approval in his tones_ observing the hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically thrown them_ _and what do ye next_ men__ _lower away_ and after him__ _and what tune is it ye pull to_ men__ _a dead whale or a stove boat__ more and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving_ grew the countenance of the old man at every shout_ while the mariners began to gaze curiously at each other_ as if marvelling how it was that they themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions_ but_ they were all eagerness again_ as ahab_ now half_revolving in his pivot_hole_ with one hand reaching high up a shroud_ and tightly_ almost convulsively grasping it_ addressed them thus__ _all ye mast_headers have before now heard me give orders about a white whale_ look ye_ d_ye see this spanish ounce of gold___holding up a broad bright coin to the sun__it is a sixteen dollar piece_ men_ d_ye see it_ mr_ starbuck_ hand me yon top_maul__ while the mate was getting the hammer_ ahab_ without speaking_ was slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket_ as if to heighten its lustre_ and without using any words was meanwhile lowly humming to himself_ producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him_ receiving the top_maul from starbuck_ he advanced towards the main_mast with the hammer uplifted in one hand_ exhibiting the gold with the other_ and with a high raised voice exclaiming_ _whosoever of ye raises me a white_headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw_ whosoever of ye raises me that white_headed whale_ with three holes punctured in his starboard fluke_look ye_ whosoever of ye raises me that same white whale_ he shall have this gold ounce_ my boys__ _huzza_ huzza__ cried the seamen_ as with swinging tarpaulins they hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast_ _it_s a white whale_ i say__ resumed ahab_ as he threw down the topmaul_ _a white whale_ skin your eyes for him_ men_ look sharp for white water_ if ye see but a bubble_ sing out__ all this while tashtego_ daggoo_ and queequeg had looked on with even more intense interest and surprise than the rest_ and at

stronger i shouted_ and more did i hammer and clinch my oath_ because of the dread in my soul_ a wild_ mystical_ sympathetical feeling was in me_ ahab_s quenchless feud seemed mine_ with greedy ears i learned the history of that murderous monster against whom i and all the others had taken our oaths of violence and revenge_ for some time past_ though at intervals only_ the unaccompanied_ secluded white whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly frequented by the sperm whale fishermen_ but not all of them knew of his existence_ only a few of them_ comparatively_ had knowingly seen him_ while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given battle to him_ was small indeed_ for_ owing to the large number of whale_cruisers_ the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire watery circumference_ many of them adventurously pushing their quest along solitary latitudes_ so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth or more on a stretch_ to encounter a single news_telling sail of any sort_ the inordinate length of each separate voyage_ the irregularity of the times of sailing from home_ all these_ with other circumstances_ direct and indirect_ long obstructed the spread through the whole world_wide whaling_fleet of the special individualizing tidings concerning moby dick_ it was hardly to be doubted_ that several vessels reported to have encountered_ at such or such a time_ or on such or such a meridian_ a sperm whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity_ which whale_ after doing great mischief to his assailants_ had completely escaped them_ to some minds it was not an unfair presumption_ i say_ that the whale in question must have been no other than moby dick_ yet as of late the sperm whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity_ cunning_ and malice in the monster attacked_ therefore it was_ that those who by accident ignorantly gave battle to moby dick_ such hunters_ perhaps_ for the most part_ were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred_ more_ as it were_ to the perils of the sperm whale fishery at large_ than to the individual cause_ in that way_ mostly_ the disastrous encounter between ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded_ and as for those who_ previously hearing of the white whale_ by chance caught sight of him_ in the beginning of the thing they had every one of them_ almost_ as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him_ as for any other whale of that species_ but at length_ such calamities did ensue in these assaults_not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles_ broken limbs_ or devouring amputations_but fatal to the last degree of fatality_ those repeated disastrous repulses_ all accumulating and piling their terrors upon moby dick_ those things had gone far to shake the fortitude of many brave hunters_ to whom the story of the white whale had eventually come_ nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate_ and still the more horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters_ for not only do fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising terrible events__as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi_ but_ in maritime life_ far more than in that of terra firma_ wild rumors abound_ wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to_ and as the sea surpasses the land in this matter_ so the whale fishery surpasses every other sort of maritime life_ in the wonderfulness and fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there_ for not only are whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors_ but of all sailors_ they are by all odds the most directly brought into contact with whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea_ face to face they not only eye its greatest marvels_ but_ hand to jaw_ give battle to them_ alone_ in such remotest waters_ that though you sailed a thousand miles_ and passed a thousand shores_ you would not come to any chiseled hearth_stone_ or aught hospitable beneath that part of the sun_ in such latitudes and longitudes_ pursuing too such a calling as he does_ the whaleman is wrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth_ no wonder_ then_ that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over the widest watery spaces_ the outblown rumors of the white whale did in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints_ and half_formed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies_ which eventually invested moby dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything that visibly appears_ so that in many cases such a panic did he finally strike_ that few who by those rumors_ at least_ had heard of the white whale_ few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his jaw_ but there were still other and more vital practical influences at work_ not even at the present day has the original prestige of the sperm whale_ as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the leviathan_ died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body_ there are those this day among them_ who_ though intelligent and courageous enough in offering battle to the greenland or right whale_ would perhaps_either from professional inexperience_ or incompetency_ or timidity_ decline a contest with the sperm whale_ at any rate_ there are plenty of whalemen_ especially among those whaling nations not sailing under the american flag_ who have never hostilely encountered the sperm whale_ but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the north_ seated on their hatches_ these men will hearken with a childish fireside interest and awe_ to the wild_ strange tales of southern whaling_ nor is the pre_eminent tremendousness of the great sperm whale anywhere more feelingly comprehended_ than on board of those prows which stem him_ and as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary times thrown its shadow before it_ we find some book naturalists_olassen and povelson_declaring the sperm whale not only to be a consternation to every other creature in the sea_ but also to be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood_ nor even down to so late a time as cuvier_s_ were these or almost similar impressions effaced_ for in his natural history_ the baron himself affirms that at sight of the sperm whale_ all fish _sharks included_ are _struck with the most lively terrors__ and _often in the precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the rocks with such violence as to cause instantaneous death__ and however the general experiences in the fishery may amend such reports as these_ yet in their full terribleness_ even to the bloodthirsty item of povelson_ the superstitious belief in them is_ in some vicissitudes of their vocation_ revived in the minds of the hunters_ so that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him_ not a few of the fishermen recalled_ in reference to moby dick_ the earlier days of the sperm whale fishery_ when it was oftentimes hard to induce long practised right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring warfare_ such men protesting that although other leviathans might be hopefully pursued_ yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition as the sperm whale was not for mortal man_ that to attempt it_ would be inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity_ on this head_ there are some remarkable documents that may be consulted_ nevertheless_ some there were_ who even in the face of these things were ready to give chase to moby dick_ and a still greater number who_ chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely_ without the specific details of any certain calamity_ and without superstitious accompaniments_ were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if offered_ one of the wild suggestions referred to_ as at last coming to be linked with the white whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined_ was the unearthly conceit that moby dick was ubiquitous_ that he had actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same instant of time_ nor_ credulous as such minds must have been_ was this conceit altogether without some faint show of superstitious probability_ for as the secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged_ even to the most erudite research_ so the hidden ways of the sperm whale when beneath the surface remain_ in great part_ unaccountable to his pursuers_ and from time to time have originated the most curious and contradictory speculations regarding them_ especially concerning the mystic modes whereby_ after sounding to a great depth_ he transports himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant points_ it is a thing well known to both american and english whale_ships_ and as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by scoresby_ that some whales have been captured far north in the pacific_ in whose bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the greenland seas_ nor is it to be gainsaid_ that in some of these instances it has been declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could not have exceeded very many days_ hence_ by inference_ it has been believed by some whalemen_ that the nor_ west passage_ so long a problem to man_ was never a problem to the whale_ so that here_ in the real living experience of living men_ the prodigies related in old times of the inland strello mountain in portugal _near whose top there was said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface__ and that still more wonderful story of the arethusa fountain near syracuse _whose waters were believed to have come from the holy land by an underground passage__ these fabulous narrations are almost fully equalled by the realities of the whalemen_ forced into familiarity_ then_ with such prodigies as these_ and knowing that after repeated_ intrepid assaults_ the white whale had escaped alive_ it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still further in their superstitions_ declaring moby dick not only ubiquitous_ but immortal _for immortality is but ubiquity in time__ that though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks_ he would still swim away unharmed_ or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick blood_ such a sight would be but a ghastly deception_ for again in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away_ his unsullied jet would once more be seen_ but even stripped of these supernatural surmisings_ there was enough in the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike the imagination with unwonted power_ for_ it was not so much his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales_ but_ as was elsewhere thrown out_a peculiar snow_white wrinkled forehead_ and a high_ pyramidical white hump_ these were his prominent features_ the tokens whereby_ even in the limitless_ uncharted seas_ he revealed his identity_ at a long distance_ to those who knew him_ the rest of his body was so streaked_ and spotted_ and marbled with the same shrouded hue_ that_ in the end_ he had gained his distinctive appellation of the white whale_ a name_ indeed_ literally justified by his vivid aspect_ when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea_ leaving a milky_way wake of creamy foam_ all spangled with golden gleamings_ nor was it his unwonted magnitude_ nor his remarkable hue_ nor yet his deformed lower jaw_ that so much invested the whale with natural terror_ as that unexampled_ intelligent malignity which_ according to specific accounts_ he had over and over again evinced in his assaults_ more than all_ his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught else_ for_ when swimming before his exulting pursuers_ with every apparent symptom of alarm_ he had several times been known to turn round suddenly_ and_ bearing down upon them_ either stave their boats to splinters_ or drive them back in consternation to their ship_ already several fatalities had attended his chase_ but though similar disasters_ however little bruited ashore_ were by no means unusual in the fishery_ yet_ in most instances_ such seemed the white whale_s infernal aforethought of ferocity_ that every dismembering or death that he caused_ was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an unintelligent agent_ judge_ then_ to what pitches of inflamed_ distracted fury the minds of his more desperate hunters were impelled_ when amid the chips of chewed boats_ and the sinking limbs of torn comrades_ they swam out of the white curds of the whale_s direful wrath into the serene_ exasperating sunlight_ that smiled on_ as if at a birth or a bridal_ his three boats stove around him_ and oars and men both whirling in the eddies_ one captain_ seizing the line_knife from his broken prow_ had dashed at the whale_ as an arkansas duellist at his foe_ blindly seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom_deep life of the whale_ that captain was ahab_ and then it was_ that suddenly sweeping his sickle_shaped lower jaw beneath him_ moby dick had reaped away ahab_s leg_ as a mower a blade of grass in the field_ no turbaned turk_ no hired venetian or malay_ could have smote him with more seeming malice_ small reason was there to doubt_ then_ that ever since that almost fatal encounter_ ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale_ all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him_ not only all his bodily woes_ but all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations_ the white whale swam before him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in them_ till they are left living on with half a heart and half a lung_ that intangible malignity which has been from the beginning_ to whose dominion even the modern christians ascribe one_half of the worlds_ which the ancient ophites of the east reverenced in their statue devil__ahab did not fall down and worship it like them_ but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale_ he pitted himself_ all mutilated_ against it_ all that most maddens and torments_ all that stirs up the lees of things_ all truth with malice in it_ all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain_ all the subtle demonisms of life and thought_ all evil_ to crazy ahab_ were visibly personified_ and made practically assailable in moby dick_ he piled upon the whale_s white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from adam down_ and then_ as if his chest had been a mortar_ he burst his hot heart_s shell upon it_ it is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at the precise time of his bodily dismemberment_ then_ in darting at the monster_ knife in hand_ he had but given loose to a sudden_ passionate_ corporal animosity_ and when he received the stroke that tore him_ he probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration_ but nothing more_ yet_ when by this collision forced to turn towards home_ and for long months of days and weeks_ ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one hammock_ rounding in mid winter that dreary_ howling patagonian cape_ then it was_ that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one another_ and so interfusing_ made him mad_ that it was only then_ on the homeward voyage_ after the encounter_ that the final monomania seized him_ seems all but certain from the fact that_ at intervals during the passage_ he was a raving lunatic_ and_ though unlimbed of a leg_ yet such vital strength yet lurked in his egyptian chest_ and was moreover intensified by his delirium_ that his mates were forced to lace him fast_ even there_ as he sailed_ raving in his hammock_ in a strait_jacket_ he swung to the mad rockings of the gales_ and_ when running into more sufferable latitudes_ the ship_ with mild stun_sails spread_ floated across the tranquil tropics_ and_ to all appearances_ the old man_s delirium seemed left behind him with the cape horn swells_ and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and air_ even then_ when he bore that firm_ collected front_ however pale_ and issued his calm orders once again_ and his mates thanked god the direful madness was now gone_ even then_ ahab_ in his hidden self_ raved on_ human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing_ when you think it fled_ it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler form_ ahab_s full lunacy subsided not_ but deepeningly contracted_ like the unabated hudson_ when that noble northman flows narrowly_ but unfathomably through the highland gorge_ but_ as in his narrow_flowing monomania_ not one jot of ahab_s broad madness had been left behind_ so in that broad madness_ not one jot of his great natural intellect had perished_ that before living agent_ now became the living instrument_ if such a furious trope may stand_ his special lunacy stormed his general sanity_ and carried it_ and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark_ so that far from having lost his strength_ ahab_ to that one end_ did now possess a thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one reasonable object_ this is much_ yet ahab_s larger_ darker_ deeper part remains unhinted_ but vain to popularize profundities_ and all truth is profound_ winding far down from within the very heart of this spiked hotel de cluny where we here stand_however grand and wonderful_ now quit it__and take your way_ ye nobler_ sadder souls_ to those vast roman halls of thermes_ where far beneath the fantastic towers of man_s upper earth_ his root of grandeur_ his whole awful essence sits in bearded state_ an antique buried beneath antiquities_ and throned on torsoes_ so with a broken throne_ the great gods mock that captive king_ so like a caryatid_ he patient sits_ upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of ages_ wind ye down there_ ye prouder_ sadder souls_ question that proud_ sad king_ a family likeness_ aye_ he did beget ye_ ye young exiled royalties_ and from your grim sire only will the old state_secret come_ now_ in his heart_ ahab had some glimpse of this_ namely_ all my means are sane_ my motive and my object mad_ yet without power to kill_ or change_ or shun the fact_ he likewise knew that to mankind he did long dissemble_ in some sort_ did still_ but that thing of his dissembling was only subject to his perceptibility_ not to his will determinate_ nevertheless_ so well did he succeed in that dissembling_ that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last_ no nantucketer thought him otherwise than but naturally grieved_ and that to the quick_ with the terrible casualty which had overtaken him_ the report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly ascribed to a kindred cause_ and so too_ all the added moodiness which always afterwards_ to the very day of sailing in the pequod on the present voyage_ sat brooding on his brow_ nor is it so very unlikely_ that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage_ on account of such dark symptoms_ the calculating people of that prudent isle were inclined to harbor the conceit_ that for those very reasons he was all the better qualified and set on edge_ for a pursuit so full of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales_ gnawed within and scorched without_ with the infixed_ unrelenting fangs of some incurable idea_ such an one_ could he be found_ would seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes_ or_ if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that_ yet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on his underlings to the attack_ but be all this as it may_ certain it is_ that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him_ ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only and all_engrossing object of hunting the white whale_ had any one of his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking in him then_ how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man_ they were bent on profitable cruises_ the profit to be counted down in dollars from the mint_ he was intent on an audacious_ immitigable_ and supernatural revenge_ here_ then_ was this grey_headed_ ungodly old man_ chasing with curses a job_s whale round the world_ at the head of a crew_ too_ chiefly made up of mongrel renegades_ and castaways_ and cannibals_morally enfeebled also_ by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right_mindedness in starbuck_ the invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in stubb_ and the pervading mediocrity in flask_ such a crew_ so officered_ seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his monomaniac revenge_ how it was that they so aboundingly responded to the old man_s ire_by what evil magic their souls were possessed_ that at times his hate seemed almost theirs_ the white whale as much their insufferable foe as his_ how all this came to be_what the white whale was to them_ or how to their unconscious understandings_ also_ in some dim_ unsuspected way_ he might have seemed the gliding great demon of the seas of life__all this to explain_ would be to dive deeper than ishmael can go_ the subterranean miner that works in us all_ how can one tell whither leads his shaft by the ever shifting_ muffled sound of his pick_ who does not feel the irresistible arm drag_ what skiff in tow of a seventy_four can stand still_ for one_ i gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and the place_ but while yet all a_rush to encounter the whale_ could see naught in that brute but the deadliest ill_ chapter ___ the whiteness of the whale_ what the white whale was to ahab_ has been hinted_ what_ at times_ he was to me_ as yet remains unsaid_ aside from those more obvious considerations touching moby dick_ which could not but occasionally awaken in any man_s soul some alarm_ there was another thought_ or rather vague_ nameless horror concerning him_ which at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest_ and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it_ that i almost despair of putting it in a comprehensible form_ it was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me_ but how can i hope to explain myself here_ and yet_ in some dim_ random way_ explain myself i must_ else all these chapters might be naught_ though in many natural objects_ whiteness refiningly enhances beauty_ as if imparting some special virtue of its own_ as in marbles_ japonicas_ and pearls_ and though various nations have in some way recognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue_ even the barbaric_ grand old kings of pegu placing the title _lord of the white elephants_ above all their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion_ and the modern kings of siam unfurling the same snow_white quadruped in the royal standard_ and the hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a snow_white charger_ and the great austrian empire_ caesarian_ heir to overlording rome_ having for the imperial colour the same imperial hue_ and though this pre_eminence in it applies to the human race itself_ giving the white man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe_ and though_ besides_ all this_ whiteness has been even made significant of gladness_ for among the romans a white stone marked a joyful day_ and though in other mortal sympathies and symbolizings_ this same hue is made the emblem of many touching_ noble things_the innocence of brides_ the benignity of age_ though among the red men of america the giving of the white belt of wampum was the deepest pledge of honour_ though in many climes_ whiteness typifies the majesty of justice in the ermine of the judge_ and contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn by milk_white steeds_ though even in the higher mysteries of the most august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness and power_ by the persian fire worshippers_ the white forked flame being held the holiest on the altar_ and in the greek mythologies_ great jove himself being made incarnate in a snow_white bull_ and though to the noble iroquois_ the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred white dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology_ that spotless_ faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could send to the great spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity_ and though directly from the latin word for white_ all christian priests derive the name of one part of their sacred vesture_ the alb or tunic_ worn beneath the cassock_ and though among the holy pomps of the romish faith_ white is specially employed in the celebration of the passion of our lord_ though in the vision of st_ john_ white robes are given to the redeemed_ and the four_and_twenty elders stand clothed in white before the great_white throne_ and the holy one that sitteth there white like wool_ yet for all these accumulated associations_ with whatever is sweet_ and honourable_ and sublime_ there yet lurks an elusive something in the innermost idea of this hue_ which strikes more of panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in blood_ this elusive quality it is_ which causes the thought of whiteness_ when divorced from more kindly associations_ and coupled with any object terrible in itself_ to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds_ witness the white bear of the poles_ and the white shark of the tropics_ what but their smooth_ flaky whiteness makes them the transcendent horrors they are_ that ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an abhorrent mildness_ even more loathsome than terrific_ to the dumb gloating of their aspect_ so that not the fierce_fanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white_shrouded bear or shark__ _with reference to the polar bear_ it may possibly be urged by him who would fain go still deeper into this matter_ that it is not the whiteness_ separately regarded_ which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that brute_ for_ analysed_ that heightened hideousness_ it might be said_ only rises from the circumstance_ that the irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love_ and hence_ by bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds_ the polar bear frightens us with so unnatural a contrast_ but even assuming all this to be true_ yet_ were it not for the whiteness_ you would not have that intensified terror_ as for the white shark_ the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that creature_ when beheld in his ordinary moods_ strangely tallies with the same quality in the polar quadruped_ this peculiarity is most vividly hit by the french in the name they bestow upon that fish_ the romish mass for the dead begins with _requiem eternam_ _eternal rest__ whence requiem denominating the mass itself_ and any other funeral music_ now_ in allusion to the white_ silent stillness of death in this shark_ and the mild deadliness of his habits_ the french call him requin_ bethink thee of the albatross_ whence come those clouds of spiritual wonderment and pale dread_ in which that white phantom sails in all imaginations_ not coleridge first threw that spell_ but god_s great_ unflattering laureate_ nature__ _i remember the first albatross i ever saw_ it was during a prolonged gale_ in waters hard upon the antarctic seas_ from my forenoon watch below_ i ascended to the overclouded deck_ and there_ dashed upon the main hatches_ i saw a regal_ feathery thing of unspotted whiteness_ and with a hooked_ roman bill sublime_ at intervals_ it arched forth its vast archangel wings_ as if to embrace some holy ark_ wondrous flutterings and throbbings shook it_ though bodily unharmed_ it uttered cries_ as some king_s ghost in supernatural distress_ through its inexpressible_ strange eyes_ methought i peeped to secrets which took hold of god_ as abraham before the angels_ i bowed myself_ the white thing was so white_ its wings so wide_ and in those for ever exiled waters_ i had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of towns_ long i gazed at that prodigy of plumage_ i cannot tell_ can only hint_ the things that darted through me then_ but at last i awoke_ and turning_ asked a sailor what bird was this_ a goney_ he replied_ goney_ never had heard that name before_ is it conceivable that this glorious thing is utterly unknown to men ashore_ never_ but some time after_ i learned that goney was some seaman_s name for albatross_ so that by no possibility could coleridge_s wild rhyme have had aught to do with those mystical impressions which were mine_ when i saw that bird upon our deck_ for neither had i then read the rhyme_ nor knew the bird to be an albatross_ yet_ in saying this_ i do but indirectly burnish a little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet_ i assert_ then_ that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chiefly lurks the secret of the spell_ a truth the more evinced in this_ that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey albatrosses_ and these i have frequently seen_ but never with such emotions as when i beheld the antarctic fowl_ but how had the mystic thing been caught_ whisper it not_ and i will tell_ with a treacherous hook and line_ as the fowl floated on the sea_ at last the captain made a postman of it_ tying a lettered_ leathern tally round its neck_ with the ship_s time and place_ and then letting it escape_ but i doubt not_ that leathern tally_ meant for man_ was taken off in heaven_ when the white fowl flew to join the wing_folding_ the invoking_ and adoring cherubim_ most famous in our western annals and indian traditions is that of the white steed of the prairies_ a magnificent milk_white charger_ large_eyed_ small_headed_ bluff_chested_ and with the dignity of a thousand monarchs in his lofty_ overscorning carriage_ he was the elected xerxes of vast herds of wild horses_ whose pastures in those days were only fenced by the rocky mountains and the alleghanies_ at their flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which every evening leads on the hosts of light_ the flashing cascade of his mane_ the curving comet of his tail_ invested him with housings more resplendent than gold and silver_beaters could have furnished him_ a most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen_ western world_ which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the glories of those primeval times when adam walked majestic as a god_ bluff_browed and fearless as this mighty steed_ whether marching amid his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that endlessly streamed it over the plains_ like an ohio_ or whether with his circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon_ the white steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through his cool milkiness_ in whatever aspect he presented himself_ always to the bravest indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe_ nor can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of this noble horse_ that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly_ which so clothed him with divineness_ and that this divineness had that in it which_ though commanding worship_ at the same time enforced a certain nameless terror_ but there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that accessory and strange glory which invests it in the white steed and albatross_ what is it that in the albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks the eye_ as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin_ it is that whiteness which invests him_ a thing expressed by the name he bears_ the albino is as well made as other men_has no substantive deformity_and yet this mere aspect of all_pervading whiteness makes him more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion_ why should this be so_ nor_ in quite other aspects_ does nature in her least palpable but not the less malicious agencies_ fail to enlist among her forces this crowning attribute of the terrible_ from its snowy aspect_ the gauntleted ghost of the southern seas has been denominated the white squall_ nor_ in some historic instances_ has the art of human malice omitted so potent an auxiliary_ how wildly it heightens the effect of that passage in froissart_ when_ masked in the snowy symbol of their faction_ the desperate white hoods of ghent murder their bailiff in the market_place_ nor_ in some things_ does the common_ hereditary experience of all mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue_ it cannot well be doubted_ that the one visible quality in the aspect of the dead which most appals the gazer_ is the marble pallor lingering there_ as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of consternation in the other world_ as of mortal trepidation here_ and from that pallor of the dead_ we borrow the expressive hue of the shroud in which we wrap them_ nor even in our superstitions do we fail to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms_ all ghosts rising in a milk_white fog_yea_ while these terrors seize us_ let us add_ that even the king of terrors_ when personified by the evangelist_ rides on his pallid horse_ therefore_ in his other moods_ symbolize whatever grand or gracious thing he will by whiteness_ no man can deny that in its profoundest idealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul_ but though without dissent this point be fixed_ how is mortal man to account for it_ to analyse it_ would seem impossible_ can we_ then_ by the citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of whiteness_though for the time either wholly or in great part stripped of all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful_ but nevertheless_ is found to exert over us the same sorcery_ however modified__can we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us to the hidden cause we seek_ let us try_ but in a matter like this_ subtlety appeals to subtlety_ and without imagination no man can follow another into these halls_ and though_ doubtless_ some at least of the imaginative impressions about to be presented may have been shared by most men_ yet few perhaps were entirely conscious of them at the time_ and therefore may not be able to recall them now_ why to the man of untutored ideality_ who happens to be but loosely acquainted with the peculiar character of the day_ does the bare mention of whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long_ dreary_ speechless processions of slow_pacing pilgrims_ down_cast and hooded with new_fallen snow_ or_ to the unread_ unsophisticated protestant of the middle american states_ why does the passing mention of a white friar or a white nun_ evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul_ or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and kings _which will not wholly account for it_ that makes the white tower of london tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an untravelled american_ than those other storied structures_ its neighbors_the byward tower_ or even the bloody_ and those sublimer towers_ the white mountains of new hampshire_ whence_ in peculiar moods_ comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare mention of that name_ while the thought of virginia_s blue ridge is full of a soft_ dewy_ distant dreaminess_ or why_ irrespective of all latitudes and longitudes_ does the name of the white sea exert such a spectralness over the fancy_ while that of the yellow sea lulls us with mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the waves_ followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets_ or_ to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance_ purely addressed to the fancy_ why_ in reading the old fairy tales of central europe_ does _the tall pale man_ of the hartz forests_ whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glides through the green of the groves_why is this phantom more terrible than all the whooping imps of the blocksburg_ nor is it_ altogether_ the remembrance of her cathedral_toppling earthquakes_ nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas_ nor the tearlessness of arid skies that never rain_ nor the sight of her wide field of leaning spires_ wrenched cope_stones_ and crosses all adroop _like canted yards of anchored fleets__ and her suburban avenues of house_walls lying over upon each other_ as a tossed pack of cards__it is not these things alone which make tearless lima_ the strangest_ saddest city thou can_st see_ for lima has taken the white veil_ and there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe_ old as pizarro_ this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new_ admits not the cheerful greenness of complete decay_ spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own distortions_ i know that_ to the common apprehension_ this phenomenon of whiteness is not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of objects otherwise terrible_ nor to the unimaginative mind is there aught of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind almost solely consists in this one phenomenon_ especially when exhibited under any form at all approaching to muteness or universality_ what i mean by these two statements may perhaps be respectively elucidated by the following examples_ first_ the mariner_ when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands_ if by night he hear the roar of breakers_ starts to vigilance_ and feels just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties_ but under precisely similar circumstances_ let him be called from his hammock to view his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness_as if from encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming round him_ then he feels a silent_ superstitious dread_ the shrouded phantom of the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost_ in vain the lead assures him he is still off soundings_ heart and helm they both go down_ he never rests till blue water is under him again_ yet where is the mariner who will tell thee_ _sir_ it was not so much the fear of striking hidden rocks_ as the fear of that hideous whiteness that so stirred me__ second_ to the native indian of peru_ the continual sight of the snowhowdahed andes conveys naught of dread_ except_ perhaps_ in the mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast altitudes_ and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be to lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes_ much the same is it with the backwoodsman of the west_ who with comparative indifference views an unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow_ no shadow of tree or twig to break the fixed trance of whiteness_ not so the sailor_ beholding the scenery of the antarctic seas_ where at times_ by some infernal trick of legerdemain in the powers of frost and air_ he_ shivering and half shipwrecked_ instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery_ views what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with its lean ice monuments and splintered crosses_ but thou sayest_ methinks that white_lead chapter about whiteness is but a white flag hung out from a craven soul_ thou surrenderest to a hypo_ ishmael_ tell me_ why this strong young colt_ foaled in some peaceful valley of vermont_ far removed from all beasts of prey_why is it that upon the sunniest day_ if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him_ so that he cannot even see it_ but only smells its wild animal muskiness_why will he start_ snort_ and with bursting eyes paw the ground in phrensies of affright_ there is no remembrance in him of any gorings of wild creatures in his green northern home_ so that the strange muskiness he smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the experience of former perils_ for what knows he_ this new england colt_ of the black bisons of distant oregon_ no_ but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute_ the instinct of the knowledge of the demonism in the world_ though thousands of miles from oregon_ still when he smells that savage musk_ the rending_ goring bison herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the prairies_ which this instant they may be trampling into dust_ thus_ then_ the muffled rollings of a milky sea_ the bleak rustlings of the festooned frosts of mountains_ the desolate shiftings of the windrowed snows of prairies_ all these_ to ishmael_ are as the shaking of that buffalo robe to the frightened colt_ though neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic sign gives forth such hints_ yet with me_ as with the colt_ somewhere those things must exist_ though in many of its aspects this visible world seems formed in love_ the invisible spheres were formed in fright_ but not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness_ and learned why it appeals with such power to the soul_ and more strange and far more portentous_why_ as we have seen_ it is at once the most meaning symbol of spiritual things_ nay_ the very veil of the christian_s deity_ and yet should be as it is_ the intensifying agent in things the most appalling to mankind_ is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids and immensities of the universe_ and thus stabs us from behind with the thought of annihilation_ when beholding the white depths of the milky way_ or is it_ that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as the visible absence of colour_ and at the same time the concrete of all colours_ is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness_ full of meaning_ in a wide landscape of snows_a colourless_ all_colour of atheism from which we shrink_ and when we consider that other theory of the natural philosophers_ that all other earthly hues_every stately or lovely emblazoning_the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods_ yea_ and the gilded velvets of butterflies_ and the butterfly cheeks of young girls_ all these are but subtile deceits_ not actually inherent in substances_ but only laid on from without_ so that all deified nature absolutely paints like the harlot_ whose allurements cover nothing but the charnel_house within_ and when we proceed further_ and consider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues_ the great principle of light_ for ever remains white or colourless in itself_ and if operating without medium upon matter_ would touch all objects_ even tulips and roses_ with its own blank tinge_pondering all this_ the palsied universe lies before us a leper_ and like wilful travellers in lapland_ who refuse to wear coloured and colouring glasses upon their eyes_ so the wretched infidel

that took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his purpose with his crew_ you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom_ and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts_ spread them before him on his screwed_down table_ then seating himself before it_ you would have seen him intently study the various lines and shadings which there met his eye_ and with slow but steady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were blank_ at intervals_ he would refer to piles of old log_books beside him_ wherein were set down the seasons and places in which_ on various former voyages of various ships_ sperm whales had been captured or seen_ while thus employed_ the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his head_ continually rocked with the motion of the ship_ and for ever threw shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow_ till it almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and courses on the wrinkled charts_ some invisible pencil was also tracing lines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead_ but it was not this night in particular that_ in the solitude of his cabin_ ahab thus pondered over his charts_ almost every night they were brought out_ almost every night some pencil marks were effaced_ and others were substituted_ for with the charts of all four oceans before him_ ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies_ with a view to the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul_ now_ to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans_ it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet_ but not so did it seem to ahab_ who knew the sets of all tides and currents_ and thereby calculating the driftings of the sperm whale_s food_ and_ also_ calling to mind the regular_ ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular latitudes_ could arrive at reasonable surmises_ almost approaching to certainties_ concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that ground in search of his prey_ so assured_ indeed_ is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the sperm whale_s resorting to given waters_ that many hunters believe that_ could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world_ were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collated_ then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to correspond in invariability to those of the herring_shoals or the flights of swallows_ on this hint_ attempts have been made to construct elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale__ _since the above was written_ the statement is happily borne out by an official circular_ issued by lieutenant maury_ of the national observatory_ washington_ april __th_ _____ by that circular_ it appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion_ and portions of it are presented in the circular_ _this chart divides the ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of longitude_ perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve columns for the twelve months_ and horizontally through each of which districts are three lines_ one to show the number of days that have been spent in each month in every district_ and the two others to show the number of days in which whales_ sperm or right_ have been seen__ besides_ when making a passage from one feeding_ground to another_ the sperm whales_ guided by some infallible instinct_say_ rather_ secret intelligence from the deity_mostly swim in veins_ as they are called_ continuing their way along a given ocean_line with such undeviating exactitude_ that no ship ever sailed her course_ by any chart_ with one tithe of such marvellous precision_ though_ in these cases_ the direction taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyor_s parallel_ and though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own unavoidable_ straight wake_ yet the arbitrary vein in which at these times he is said to swim_ generally embraces some few miles in width _more or less_ as the vein is presumed to expand or contract__ but never exceeds the visual sweep from the whale_ship_s mast_heads_ when circumspectly gliding along this magic zone_ the sum is_ that at particular seasons within that breadth and along that path_ migrating whales may with great confidence be looked for_ and hence not only at substantiated times_ upon well known separate feeding_grounds_ could ahab hope to encounter his prey_ but in crossing the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could_ by his art_ so place and time himself on his way_ as even then not to be wholly without prospect of a meeting_ there was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his delirious but still methodical scheme_ but not so in the reality_ perhaps_ though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons for particular grounds_ yet in general you cannot conclude that the herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year_ say_ will turn out to be identically the same with those that were found there the preceding season_ though there are peculiar and unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved true_ in general_ the same remark_ only within a less wide limit_ applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured_ aged sperm whales_ so that though moby dick had in a former year been seen_ for example_ on what is called the seychelle ground in the indian ocean_ or volcano bay on the japanese coast_ yet it did not follow_ that were the pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season_ she would infallibly encounter him there_ so_ too_ with some other feeding grounds_ where he had at times revealed himself_ but all these seemed only his casual stopping_places and ocean_inns_ so to speak_ not his places of prolonged abode_ and where ahab_s chances of accomplishing his object have hitherto been spoken of_ allusion has only been made to whatever way_side_ antecedent_ extra prospects were his_ ere a particular set time or place were attained_ when all possibilities would become probabilities_ and_ as ahab fondly thought_ every possibility the next thing to a certainty_ that particular set time and place were conjoined in the one technical phrase_the season_on_the_line_ for there and then_ for several consecutive years_ moby dick had been periodically descried_ lingering in those waters for awhile_ as the sun_ in its annual round_ loiters for a predicted interval in any one sign of the zodiac_ there it was_ too_ that most of the deadly encounters with the white whale had taken place_ there the waves were storied with his deeds_ there also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance_ but in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with which ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt_ he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one crowning fact above mentioned_ however flattering it might be to those hopes_ nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest_ now_ the pequod had sailed from nantucket at the very beginning of the season_on_the_line_ no possible endeavor then could enable her commander to make the great passage southwards_ double cape horn_ and then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial pacific in time to cruise there_ therefore_ he must wait for the next ensuing season_ yet the premature hour of the pequod_s sailing had_ perhaps_ been correctly selected by ahab_ with a view to this very complexion of things_ because_ an interval of three hundred and sixty_five days and nights was before him_ an interval which_ instead of impatiently enduring ashore_ he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt_ if by chance the white whale_ spending his vacation in seas far remote from his periodical feeding_grounds_ should turn up his wrinkled brow off the persian gulf_ or in the bengal bay_ or china seas_ or in any other waters haunted by his race_ so that monsoons_ pampas_ nor__westers_ harmattans_ trades_ any wind but the levanter and simoon_ might blow moby dick into the devious zig_zag world_circle of the pequod_s circumnavigating wake_ but granting all this_ yet_ regarded discreetly and coolly_ seems it not but a mad idea_ this_ that in the broad boundless ocean_ one solitary whale_ even if encountered_ should be thought capable of individual recognition from his hunter_ even as a white_bearded mufti in the thronged thoroughfares of constantinople_ yes_ for the peculiar snow_white brow of moby dick_ and his snow_white hump_ could not but be unmistakable_ and have i not tallied the whale_ ahab would mutter to himself_ as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he would throw himself back in reveries_tallied him_ and shall he escape_ his broad fins are bored_ and scalloped out like a lost sheep_s ear_ and here_ his mad mind would run on in a breathless race_ till a weariness and faintness of pondering came over him_ and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recover his strength_ ah_ god_ what trances of torments does that man endure who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire_ he sleeps with clenched hands_ and wakes with his own bloody nails in his palms_ often_ when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid dreams of the night_ which_ resuming his own intense thoughts through the day_ carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies_ and whirled them round and round and round in his blazing brain_ till the very throbbing of his life_spot became insufferable anguish_ and when_ as was sometimes the case_ these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up from its base_ and a chasm seemed opening in him_ from which forked flames and lightnings shot up_ and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap down among them_ when this hell in himself yawned beneath him_ a wild cry would be heard through the ship_ and with glaring eyes ahab would burst from his state room_ as though escaping from a bed that was on fire_ yet these_ perhaps_ instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness_ or fright at his own resolve_ were but the plainest tokens of its intensity_ for_ at such times_ crazy ahab_ the scheming_ unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale_ this ahab that had gone to his hammock_ was not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror again_ the latter was the eternal_ living principle or soul in him_ and in sleep_ being for the time dissociated from the characterizing mind_ which at other times employed it for its outer vehicle or agent_ it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity of the frantic thing_ of which_ for the time_ it was no longer an integral_ but as the mind does not exist unless leagued with the soul_ therefore it must have been that_ in ahab_s case_ yielding up all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose_ that purpose_ by its own sheer inveteracy of will_ forced itself against gods and devils into a kind of self_assumed_ independent being of its own_ nay_ could grimly live and burn_ while the common vitality to which it was conjoined_ fled horror_stricken from the unbidden and unfathered birth_ therefore_ the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes_ when what seemed ahab rushed from his room_ was for the time but a vacated thing_ a formless somnambulistic being_ a ray of living light_ to be sure_ but without an object to colour_ and therefore a blankness in itself_ god help thee_ old man_ thy thoughts have created a creature in thee_ and he whose intense thinking thus makes him a prometheus_ a vulture feeds upon that heart for ever_ that vulture the very creature he creates_ chapter ___ the affidavit_ so far as what there may be of a narrative in this book_ and_ indeed_ as indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious particulars in the habits of sperm whales_ the foregoing chapter_ in its earlier part_ is as important a one as will be found in this volume_ but the leading matter of it requires to be still further and more familiarly enlarged upon_ in order to be adequately understood_ and moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance of the entire subject may induce in some minds_ as to the natural verity of the main points of this affair_ i care not to perform this part of my task methodically_ but shall be content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of items_ practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman_ and from these citations_ i take it_the conclusion aimed at will naturally follow of itself_ first_ i have personally known three instances where a whale_ after receiving a harpoon_ has effected a complete escape_ and_ after an interval _in one instance of three years__ has been again struck by the same hand_ and slain_ when the two irons_ both marked by the same private cypher_ have been taken from the body_ in the instance where three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons_ and i think it may have been something more than that_ the man who darted them happening_ in the interval_ to go in a trading ship on a voyage to africa_ went ashore there_ joined a discovery party_ and penetrated far into the interior_ where he travelled for a period of nearly two years_ often endangered by serpents_ savages_ tigers_ poisonous miasmas_ with all the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of unknown regions_ meanwhile_ the whale he had struck must also have been on its travels_ no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe_ brushing with its flanks all the coasts of africa_ but to no purpose_ this man and this whale again came together_ and the one vanquished the other_ i say i_ myself_ have known three instances similar to this_ that is in two of them i saw the whales struck_ and_ upon the second attack_ saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them_ afterwards taken from the dead fish_ in the three_year instance_ it so fell out that i was in the boat both times_ first and last_ and the last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale_s eye_ which i had observed there three years previous_ i say three years_ but i am pretty sure it was more than that_ here are three instances_ then_ which i personally know the truth of_ but i have heard of many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there is no good ground to impeach_ secondly_ it is well known in the sperm whale fishery_ however ignorant the world ashore may be of it_ that there have been several memorable historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at distant times and places popularly cognisable_ why such a whale became thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from other whales_ for however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be_ they soon put an end to his peculiarities by killing him_ and boiling him down into a peculiarly valuable oil_ no_ the reason was this_ that from the fatal experiences of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about such a whale as there did about rinaldo rinaldini_ insomuch that most fishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their tarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea_ without seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance_ like some poor devils ashore that happen to know an irascible great man_ they make distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street_ lest if they pursued the acquaintance further_ they might receive a summary thump for their presumption_ but not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual celebrity_nay_ you may call it an ocean_wide renown_ not only was he famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death_ but he was admitted into all the rights_ privileges_ and distinctions of a name_ had as much a name indeed as cambyses or caesar_ was it not so_ o timor tom_ thou famed leviathan_ scarred like an iceberg_ who so long did_st lurk in the oriental straits of that name_ whose spout was oft seen from the palmy beach of ombay_ was it not so_ o new zealand jack_ thou terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the vicinity of the tattoo land_ was it not so_ o morquan_ king of japan_ whose lofty jet they say at times assumed the semblance of a snow_white cross against the sky_ was it not so_ o don miguel_ thou chilian whale_ marked like an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back_ in plain prose_ here are four whales as well known to the students of cetacean history as marius or sylla to the classic scholar_ but this is not all_ new zealand tom and don miguel_ after at various times creating great havoc among the boats of different vessels_ were finally gone in quest of_ systematically hunted out_ chased and killed by valiant whaling captains_ who heaved up their anchors with that express object as much in view_ as in setting out through the narragansett woods_ captain butler of old had it in his mind to capture that notorious murderous savage annawon_ the headmost warrior of the indian king philip_ i do not know where i can find a better place than just here_ to make mention of one or two other things_ which to me seem important_ as in printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the whole story of the white whale_ more especially the catastrophe_ for this is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires full as much bolstering as error_ so ignorant are most landsmen of some of the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world_ that without some hints touching the plain facts_ historical and otherwise_ of the fishery_ they might scout at moby dick as a monstrous fable_ or still worse and more detestable_ a hideous and intolerable allegory_ first_ though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general perils of the grand fishery_ yet they have nothing like a fixed_ vivid conception of those perils_ and the frequency with which they recur_ one reason perhaps is_ that not one in fifty of the actual disasters and deaths by casualties in the fishery_ ever finds a public record at home_ however transient and immediately forgotten that record_ do you suppose that that poor fellow there_ who this moment perhaps caught by the whale_line off the coast of new guinea_ is being carried down to the bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan_do you suppose that that poor fellow_s name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will read to_morrow at your breakfast_ no_ because the mails are very irregular between here and new guinea_ in fact_ did you ever hear what might be called regular news direct or indirect from new guinea_ yet i tell you that upon one particular voyage which i made to the pacific_ among many others we spoke thirty different ships_ every one of which had had a death by a whale_ some of them more than one_ and three that had each lost a boat_s crew_ for god_s sake_ be economical with your lamps and candles_ not a gallon you burn_ but at least one drop of man_s blood was spilled for it_ secondly_ people ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is an enormous creature of enormous power_ but i have ever found that when narrating to them some specific example of this two_fold enormousness_ they have significantly complimented me upon my facetiousness_ when_ i declare upon my soul_ i had no more idea of being facetious than moses_ when he wrote the history of the plagues of egypt_ but fortunately the special point i here seek can be established upon testimony entirely independent of my own_ that point is this_ the sperm whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful_ knowing_ and judiciously malicious_ as with direct aforethought to stave in_ utterly destroy_ and sink a large ship_ and what is more_ the sperm whale has done it_ first_ in the year ____ the ship essex_ captain pollard_ of nantucket_ was cruising in the pacific ocean_ one day she saw spouts_ lowered her boats_ and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales_ ere long_ several of the whales were wounded_ when_ suddenly_ a very large whale escaping from the boats_ issued from the shoal_ and bore directly down upon the ship_ dashing his forehead against her hull_ he so stove her in_ that in less than _ten minutes_ she settled down and fell over_ not a surviving plank of her has been seen since_ after the severest exposure_ part of the crew reached the land in their boats_ being returned home at last_ captain pollard once more sailed for the pacific in command of another ship_ but the gods shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers_ for the second time his ship was utterly lost_ and forthwith forswearing the sea_ he has never tempted it since_ at this day captain pollard is a resident of nantucket_ i have seen owen chace_ who was chief mate of the essex at the time of the tragedy_ i have read his plain and faithful narrative_ i have conversed with his son_ and all this within a few miles of the scene of the catastrophe__ _the following are extracts from chace_s narrative_ _every fact seemed to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which directed his operations_ he made two several attacks upon the ship_ at a short interval between them_ both of which_ according to their direction_ were calculated to do us the most injury_ by being made ahead_ and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the shock_ to effect which_ the exact manoeuvres which he made were necessary_ his aspect was most horrible_ and such as indicated resentment and fury_ he came directly from the shoal which we had just before entered_ and in which we had struck three of his companions_ as if fired with revenge for their sufferings__ again_ _at all events_ the whole circumstances taken together_ all happening before my own eyes_ and producing_ at the time_ impressions in my mind of decided_ calculating mischief_ on the part of the whale _many of which impressions i cannot now recall__ induce me to be satisfied that i am correct in my opinion__ here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship_ during a black night in an open boat_ when almost despairing of reaching any hospitable shore_ _the dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing_ the fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest_ or dashed upon hidden rocks_ with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful contemplation_ seemed scarcely entitled to a moment_s thought_ the dismal looking wreck_ and the horrid aspect and revenge of the whale_ wholly engrossed my reflections_ until day again made its appearance__ in another place_p_ ____he speaks of _the mysterious and mortal attack of the animal__ secondly_ the ship union_ also of nantucket_ was in the year ____ totally lost off the azores by a similar onset_ but the authentic particulars of this catastrophe i have never chanced to encounter_ though from the whale hunters i have now and then heard casual allusions to it_ thirdly_ some eighteen or twenty years ago commodore j___ then commanding an american sloop_of_war of the first class_ happened to be dining with a party of whaling captains_ on board a nantucket ship in the harbor of oahu_ sandwich islands_ conversation turning upon whales_ the commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present_ he peremptorily denied for example_ that any whale could so smite his stout sloop_of_war as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful_ very good_ but there is more coming_ some weeks after_ the commodore set sail in this impregnable craft for valparaiso_ but he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm whale_ that begged a few moments_ confidential business with him_ that business consisted in fetching the commodore_s craft such a thwack_ that with all his pumps going he made straight for the nearest port to heave down and repair_ i am not superstitious_ but i consider the commodore_s interview with that whale as providential_ was not saul of tarsus converted from unbelief by a similar fright_ i tell you_ the sperm whale will stand no nonsense_ i will now refer you to langsdorff_s voyages for a little circumstance in point_ peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof_ langsdorff_ you must know by the way_ was attached to the russian admiral krusenstern_s famous discovery expedition in the beginning of the present century_ captain langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter_ _by the thirteenth of may our ship was ready to sail_ and the next day we were out in the open sea_ on our way to ochotsh_ the weather was very clear and fine_ but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on our fur clothing_ for some days we had very little wind_ it was not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up_ an uncommon large whale_ the body of which was larger than the ship itself_ lay almost at the surface of the water_ but was not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship_ which was in full sail_ was almost upon him_ so that it was impossible to prevent its striking against him_ we were thus placed in the most imminent danger_ as this gigantic creature_ setting up its back_ raised the ship three feet at least out of the water_ the masts reeled_ and the sails fell altogether_ while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck_ concluding that we had struck upon some rock_ instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity_ captain d_wolf applied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not the vessel had received any damage from the shock_ but we found that very happily it had escaped entirely uninjured__ now_ the captain d_wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in question_ is a new englander_ who_ after a long life of unusual adventures as a sea_captain_ this day resides in the village of dorchester near boston_ i have the honour of being a nephew of his_ i have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in langsdorff_ he substantiates every word_ the ship_ however_ was by no means a large one_ a russian craft built on the siberian coast_ and purchased by my uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home_ in that up and down manly book of old_fashioned adventure_ so full_ too_ of honest wonders_the voyage of lionel wafer_ one of ancient dampier_s old chums_i found a little matter set down so like that just quoted from langsdorff_ that i cannot forbear inserting it here for a corroborative example_ if such be needed_ lionel_ it seems_ was on his way to _john ferdinando__ as he calls the modern juan fernandes_ _in our way thither__ he says_ _about four o_clock in the morning_ when we were about one hundred and fifty leagues from the main of america_ our ship felt a terrible shock_ which put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where they were or what to think_ but every one began to prepare for death_ and_ indeed_ the shock was so sudden and violent_ that we took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock_ but when the amazement was a little over_ we cast the lead_ and sounded_ but found no ground_____ the suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their carriages_ and several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks_ captain davis_ who lay with his head on a gun_ was thrown out of his cabin__ lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an earthquake_ and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a great earthquake_ somewhere about that time_ did actually do great mischief along the spanish land_ but i should not much wonder if_ in the darkness of that early hour of the morning_ the shock was after all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath_ i might proceed with several more examples_ one way or another known to me_ of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale_ in more than one instance_ he has been known_ not only to chase the assailing boats back to their ships_ but to pursue the ship itself_ and long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks_ the english ship pusie hall can tell a story on that head_ and_ as for his strength_ let me say_ that there have been examples where the lines attached to a running sperm whale have_ in a calm_ been transferred to the ship_ and secured there_ the whale towing her great hull through the water_ as a horse walks off with a cart_ again_ it is very often observed that_ if the sperm whale_ once struck_ is allowed time to rally_ he then acts_ not so often with blind rage_ as with wilful_ deliberate designs of destruction to his pursuers_ nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his character_ that upon being attacked he will frequently open his mouth_ and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive minutes_ but i must be content with only one more and a concluding illustration_ a remarkable and most significant one_ by which you will not fail to see_ that not only is the most marvellous event in this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day_ but that these marvels _like all marvels_ are mere repetitions of the ages_ so that for the millionth time we say amen with solomon_verily there is nothing new under the sun_ in the sixth christian century lived procopius_ a christian magistrate of constantinople_ in the days when justinian was emperor and belisarius general_ as many know_ he wrote the history of his own times_ a work every way of uncommon value_ by the best authorities_ he has always been considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating historian_ except in some one or two particulars_ not at all affecting the matter presently to be mentioned_ now_ in this history of his_ procopius mentions that_ during the term of his prefecture at constantinople_ a great sea_monster was captured in the neighboring propontis_ or sea of marmora_ after having destroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty years_ a fact thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be gainsaid_ nor is there any reason it should be_ of what precise species this sea_monster was_ is not mentioned_ but as he destroyed ships_ as well as for other reasons_ he must have been a whale_ and i am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale_ and i will tell you why_ for a long time i fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it_ even now i am certain that those seas are not_ and perhaps never can be_ in the present constitution of things_ a place for his habitual gregarious resort_ but further investigations have recently proved to me_ that in modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the mediterranean_ i am told_ on good authority_ that on the barbary coast_ a commodore davis of the british navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale_ now_ as a vessel of war readily passes through the dardanelles_ hence a sperm whale could_ by the same route_ pass out of the mediterranean into the propontis_ in the propontis_ as far as i can learn_ none of that peculiar substance called brit is to be found_ the aliment of the right whale_ but i have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale_squid or cuttle_fish_lurks at the bottom of that sea_ because large creatures_ but by no means the largest of that sort_ have been found at its surface_ if_ then_ you properly put these statements together_ and reason upon them a bit_ you will clearly perceive that_ according to all human reasoning_ procopius_s sea_monster_ that for half a century stove the ships of a roman emperor_ must in all probability have been a sperm whale_ chapter ___ surmises_ though_ consumed with the hot fire of his purpose_ ahab in all his thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of moby dick_ though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that one passion_ nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman_s ways_ altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage_ or at least if this were otherwise_ there were not wanting other motives much more influential with him_ it would be refining too much_ perhaps_ even considering his monomania_ to hint that his vindictiveness towards the white whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all sperm whales_ and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he multiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one he hunted_ but if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable_ there were still additional considerations which_ though not so strictly according with the wildness of his ruling passion_ yet were by no means incapable of swaying him_ to accomplish his object ahab must use tools_ and of all tools used in the shadow of the moon_ men are most apt to get out of order_ he knew_ for example_ that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was over starbuck_ yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual mastership_ for to the purely spiritual_ the intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation_ starbuck_s body and starbuck_s coerced will were ahab_s_ so long as ahab kept his magnet at starbuck_s brain_ still he knew that for all this the chief mate_ in his soul_ abhorred his captain_s quest_ and could he_ would joyfully disintegrate himself from it_ or even frustrate it_ it might be that a long interval would elapse ere the white whale was seen_ during that long interval starbuck would ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against his captain_s leadership_ unless some ordinary_ prudential_ circumstantial influences were brought to bear upon him_ not only that_ but the subtle insanity of ahab respecting moby dick was noways more significantly manifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that_ for the present_ the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it_ that the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure background _for few men_s courage is proof against protracted meditation unrelieved by action__ that when they stood their long night watches_ his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of than moby dick_ for however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had hailed the announcement of his quest_ yet all sailors of all sorts are more or less capricious and unreliable_they live in the varying outer weather_ and they inhale its fickleness_and when retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit_ however promissory of life and passion in the end_ it is above all things requisite that temporary interests and employments should intervene and hold them healthily suspended for the final dash_ nor was ahab unmindful of another thing_ in times of strong emotion mankind disdain all base considerations_ but such times are evanescent_ the permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man_ thought ahab_ is sordidness_ granting that the white whale fully incites the hearts of this my savage crew_ and playing round their savageness even breeds a certain generous knight_errantism in them_ still_ while for the love of it they give chase to moby dick_ they must also have food for their more common_ daily appetites_ for even the high lifted and chivalric crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two thousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre_ without committing burglaries_ picking pockets_ and gaining other pious perquisites by the way_ had they been strictly held to their one final and romantic object_that final and romantic object_ too many would have turned from in disgust_ i will not strip these men_ thought ahab_ of all hopes of cash_aye_ cash_ they may scorn cash now_ but let some months go by_ and no perspective promise of it to them_ and then this same quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them_ this same cash would soon cashier ahab_ nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related to ahab personally_ having impulsively_ it is probable_ and perhaps somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the pequod_s voyage_ ahab was now entirely conscious that_ in so doing_ he had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of usurpation_ and with perfect impunity_ both moral and legal_ his crew if so disposed_ and to that end competent_ could refuse all further obedience to him_ and even violently wrest from him the command_ from even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation_ and the possible consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground_ ahab must of course have been most anxious to protect himself_ that protection could only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand_ backed by a heedful_ closely calculating attention to every minute atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to be subjected to_ for all these reasons then_ and others perhaps too analytic to be verbally developed here_ ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good degree continue true to the natural_ nominal purpose of the pequod_s voyage_ observe all customary usages_ and not only that_ but force himself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general pursuit of his profession_ be all this as it may_ his voice was now often heard hailing the three mast_heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look_out_ and not omit reporting even a porpoise_ this vigilance was not long without reward_ chapter ___ the mat_maker_ it was a cloudy_ sultry afternoon_ the seamen were lazily lounging about the decks_ or vacantly gazing over into the lead_coloured waters_ queequeg and i were mildly employed weaving what is called a sword_mat_ for an additional lashing to our boat_ so still and subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene_ and such an incantation of reverie lurked in the air_ that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own invisible self_ i was the attendant or page of queequeg_ while busy at the mat_ as i kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the long yarns of the warp_ using my own hand for the shuttle_ and as queequeg_ standing sideways_ ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword between the threads_ and idly looking off upon the water_ carelessly and unthinkingly drove home every yarn_ i say so strange a dreaminess did there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea_ only broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword_ that it seemed as if this were the loom of time_ and i myself were a shuttle mechanically weaving and weaving away at the fates_ there lay the fixed threads of the warp subject to but one single_ ever returning_ unchanging vibration_ and that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise interblending of other threads with its own_ this warp seemed necessity_ and here_ thought i_ with my own hand i ply my own shuttle and weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads_ meantime_ queequeg_s impulsive_ indifferent sword_ sometimes hitting the woof slantingly_ or crookedly_ or strongly_ or weakly_ as the case might be_ and by this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding contrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric_ this savage_s sword_ thought i_ which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and woof_ this easy_ indifferent sword must be chance_aye_ chance_ free will_ and necessity_nowise incompatible_all interweavingly working together_ the straight warp of necessity_ not to be swerved from its ultimate course_its every alternating vibration_ indeed_ only tending to that_ free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads_ and chance_ though restrained in its play within the right lines of necessity_ and sideways in its motions directed by free will_ though thus prescribed to by both_ chance by turns rules either_ and has the last featuring blow at events_ thus we were weaving and weaving away when i started at a sound so strange_ long drawn_ and musically wild and unearthly_ that the ball of free will dropped from my hand_ and i stood gazing up at the clouds whence that voice dropped like a wing_ high aloft in the cross_trees was that mad gay_header_ tashtego_ his body was reaching eagerly forward_ his hand stretched out like a wand_ and at brief sudden intervals he continued his cries_ to be sure the same sound was that very moment perhaps being heard all over the seas_ from hundreds of whalemen_s look_outs perched as high in the air_ but from few of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous cadence as from tashtego the indian_s_ as he stood hovering over you half suspended in air_ so wildly and eagerly peering towards the horizon_ you would have thought him some prophet or seer beholding the shadows of fate_ and by those wild cries announcing their coming_ _there she blows_ there_ there_ there_ she blows_ she blows__ _where_away__ _on the lee_beam_ about two miles off_ a school of them__ instantly all was commotion_ the sperm whale blows as a clock ticks_ with the same undeviating and reliable uniformity_ and thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from other tribes of his genus_ _there go flukes__ was now the cry from tashtego_ and the whales disappeared_ _quick_ steward__ cried ahab_ _time_ time__ dough_boy hurried below_ glanced at the watch_ and reported the exact minute to ahab_ the ship was now kept away from the wind_ and she went gently rolling before it_ tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to leeward_ we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of our bows_ for that singular craft at times evinced by the sperm whale when_ sounding with his head in one direction_ he nevertheless_ while concealed beneath the surface_ mills round_ and swiftly swims off in the opposite quarter_this deceitfulness of his could not now be in action_ for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by tashtego had been in any way alarmed_ or indeed knew at all of our vicinity_ one of the men selected for shipkeepers_that is_ those not appointed to the boats_ by this time relieved the indian at the main_mast head_ the sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down_ the line tubs were fixed in their places_ the cranes were thrust out_ the mainyard was backed_ and the three boats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over high cliffs_ outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand clung to the rail_ while one foot was expectantly poised on the gunwale_ so look the long line of man_of_war_s men about to throw themselves on board an enemy_s ship_ but at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took every eye from the whale_ with a start all glared at dark ahab_ who was surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air_ chapter ___ the first lowering_ the phantoms_ for so they then seemed_ were flitting on the other side of the deck_ and_ with a noiseless celerity_ were casting loose the tackles and bands of the boat which swung there_ this boat had always been deemed one of the spare boats_ though technically called the captain_s_ on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter_ the figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart_ with one white tooth evilly protruding from its steel_like lips_ a rumpled chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him_ with wide black trowsers of the same dark stuff_ but strangely crowning this ebonness was a glistening white plaited turban_ the living hair braided and coiled round and round upon his head_ less swart in aspect_ the companions of this figure were of that vivid_ tiger_yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the

the affair still left abundant room for all manner of wild conjectures as to dark ahab_s precise agency in the matter from the beginning_ for me_ i silently recalled the mysterious shadows i had seen creeping on board the pequod during the dim nantucket dawn_ as well as the enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable elijah_ meantime_ ahab_ out of hearing of his officers_ having sided the furthest to windward_ was still ranging ahead of the other boats_ a circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him_ those tiger yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone_ like five trip_hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength_ which periodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst boiler out of a mississippi steamer_ as for fedallah_ who was seen pulling the harpooneer oar_ he had thrown aside his black jacket_ and displayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the gunwale_ clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery horizon_ while at the other end of the boat ahab_ with one arm_ like a fencer_s_ thrown half backward into the air_ as if to counterbalance any tendency to trip_ ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar as in a thousand boat lowerings ere the white whale had torn him_ all at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed_ while the

tossings of his chip of a craft_ and silently eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea_ not very far distant flask_s boat was also lying breathlessly still_ its commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead_ a stout sort of post rooted in the keel_ and rising some two feet above the level of the stern platform_ it is used for catching turns with the whale line_ its top is not more spacious than the palm of a man_s hand_ and standing upon such a base as that_ flask seemed perched at the mast_head of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks_ but little king_post was small

pedestal_ _good a mast_head as any_ sir_ will you mount__ _that i will_ and thank ye very much_ my fine fellow_ only i wish you fifty feet taller__ whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the boat_ the gigantic negro_ stooping a little_ presented his flat palm to flask_s foot_ and then putting flask_s hand on his hearse_plumed head and bidding him spring as he himself should toss_ with one dexterous fling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders_ and here was flask now standing_ daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a breastband to lean against and steady himself by_ at any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect posture in his boat_ even when pitched about by the most riotously perverse and cross_running seas_ still more strange to see him giddily perched upon the loggerhead itself_ under such circumstances_ but the sight of little flask mounted upon gigantic daggoo was yet more curious_ for sustaining himself with a cool_ indifferent_ easy_ unthought of_ barbaric majesty_ the noble negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form_ on his broad back_ flaxen_haired flask seemed a snow_flake_ the bearer looked nobler than the rider_ though truly vivacious_ tumultuous_ ostentatious little flask would now and then

fright_ and if that were the case_ stubb_ as his wont in such cases_ it seems_ was resolved to solace the languishing interval with his pipe_ he withdrew it from his hatband_ where he always wore it aslant like a feather_ he loaded it_ and rammed home the loading with his thumb_end_ but hardly had he ignited his match across the rough sandpaper of his hand_ when tashtego_ his harpooneer_ whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed stars_ suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat_ crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry_ _down_ down all_ and give way__there

over it_ and suffusingly blowing off to leeward_ like the confused scud from white rolling billows_ the air around suddenly vibrated and tingled_ as it were_ like the air over intensely heated plates of iron_ beneath this atmospheric waving and curling_ and partially beneath a thin layer of water_ also_ the whales were swimming_ seen in advance of all the other indications_ the puffs of vapour they spouted_ seemed their forerunning couriers and detached flying outriders_ all four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled water and air_ but it bade fair to outstrip them_ it flew on and on_ as a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the hills_ _pull_ pull_ my good boys__ said starbuck_ in the lowest possible but intensest concentrated whisper to his men_ while the sharp fixed glance from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow_ almost seemed as two visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses_ he did not say much to his crew_ though_ nor did his crew say anything to him_ only the silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his peculiar whispers_ now harsh with command_ now soft with entreaty_ how different the

life in the active perils of the chase_ so tamerlane_s soldiers often argued with tears in their eyes_ whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried into the thickest of the fight_ but with ahab the question assumed a modified aspect_ considering that with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger_ considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and extraordinary difficulties_ that every individual moment_ indeed_ then comprises a peril_ under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed man to enter a whale_boat in the hunt_ as a general thing_ the joint_owners of the pequod must have plainly thought not_ ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of the chase_ for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving his orders in person_ yet for captain ahab to have a boat actually apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt_above all for captain ahab to be supplied with five extra men_ as that same boat_s crew_ he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads of the owners of the pequod_ therefore he had not solicited a boat_s crew from them_ nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head_ nevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all that matter_ until cabaco_s published discovery_ the sailors had little foreseen it_ though to be sure when_ after being a little while out of port_ all hands had concluded the customary business of fitting the whaleboats for service_ when some time after this ahab was now and then found bestirring himself in the matter of making thole_pins with his own hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats_ and even solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers_ which when the line is running out are pinned over the groove in the bow_ when all this was observed in him_ and particularly his solicitude in having an extra coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat_ as if to make it better withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb_ and also the anxiety he evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board_ or clumsy cleat_ as it is sometimes called_ the horizontal piece in the boat_s bow for bracing the knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale_ when it was observed how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fixed in the semi_circular depression in the cleat_ and with the carpenter_s chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a little there_ all these things_ i say_ had awakened much interest and curiosity at the time_ but almost everybody supposed that this particular preparative heedfulness in ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of moby dick_ for he had already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster in person_ but such a supposition did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any boat_s crew being assigned to that boat_ now_ with

still she rushed along_ as if two antagonistic influences were struggling in her_one to mount direct to heaven_ the other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal_ and had you watched ahab_s face that night_ you would have thought that in him also two different things were warring_ while his one live leg made lively echoes along the deck_ every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a coffin_tap_ on life and death this old man walked_ but though the ship so swiftly sped_ and though from every eye_ like arrows_ the eager glances shot_ yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night_ every sailor swore he saw it once_ but not a second time_ this midnight_spout had almost grown a forgotten thing_ when_ some days after_ lo_ at the same silent hour_ it was again announced_ again it was descried by all_ but upon making sail to overtake it_ once more it disappeared as if it had never been_ and so it served us night after night_ till no one heeded it but to wonder at it_ mysteriously jetted into the clear moonlight_ or starlight_ as the case might be_ disappearing again for one whole day_ or two days_ or three_ and somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still further and further in our van_ this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring us on_ nor with the immemorial superstition of their race_ and in accordance with the preternaturalness_ as it seemed_ which in many things invested the pequod_ were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that whenever and wherever descried_ at however remote times_ or in however far apart latitudes and longitudes_ that unnearable spout was cast by one self_same whale_ and that whale_ moby dick_ for a time_ there reigned_ too_ a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition_ as if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on_ in order that the monster might turn round upon us_ and rend us at last in the remotest and most savage seas_ these temporary apprehensions_ so vague but so awful_ derived a wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather_ in which_ beneath all its blue blandness_ some thought there lurked a devilish charm_ as for days and days we voyaged along_ through seas so wearily_ lonesomely mild_ that all space_ in repugnance to our vengeful errand_ seemed vacating itself of life before our urn_like prow_ but_ at last_ when turning to the eastward_ the cape winds began howling around us_ and we rose and fell upon the long_ troubled seas that are there_ when the ivory_tusked pequod sharply bowed to the blast_ and gored the dark waves in her madness_ till_ like showers of silver chips_ the foam_flakes flew over her bulwarks_ then all this desolate vacuity of life went away_ but gave place to sights more dismal than before_ close to our bows_ strange forms in the water darted hither and thither before us_ while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea_ravens_ and every morning_ perched on our stays_ rows of these birds were seen_ and spite of our hootings_ for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp_ as though they deemed our ship some drifting_ uninhabited craft_ a thing appointed to desolation_ and therefore fit roosting_place for their homeless selves_ and heaved and heaved_ still unrestingly heaved the black sea_ as if its vast tides were a conscience_ and the great mundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering it had bred_ cape of good hope_ do they call ye_ rather cape tormentoso_ as called of yore_ for long allured by the perfidious silences that before had attended us_ we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea_ where guilty beings transformed into those fowls and these fish_ seemed condemned to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store_ or beat that black air without any horizon_ but calm_ snow_white_ and unvarying_ still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky_ still beckoning us on from before_ the solitary jet would at times be descried_ during all this blackness of the elements_ ahab_ though assuming for the time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous deck_ manifested the gloomiest reserve_ and more seldom than ever addressed his mates_ in tempestuous times like these_ after everything above and aloft has been secured_ nothing more can be done but passively to await the issue of the gale_ then captain and crew become practical fatalists_ so_ with his ivory leg inserted into its accustomed hole_ and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud_ ahab for hours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward_ while an occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very eyelashes together_ meantime_ the crew driven from the forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows_ stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist_ and the better to guard against the leaping waves_ each man had slipped himself into a sort of bowline secured to the rail_ in which he swung as in a loosened belt_ few or no words were spoken_ and the silent ship_ as if manned by painted sailors in wax_ day after day tore on through all the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac waves_ by night the same muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed_ still in silence the men swung in the bowlines_ still wordless ahab stood up to the blast_ even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not seek that repose in his hammock_ never could starbuck forget the old man_s aspect_ when one night going down into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood_ he saw him with closed eyes sitting straight in his floor_screwed chair_ the rain and half_melted sleet of the storm from which he had some time before emerged_ still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and coat_ on the table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of tides and currents which have previously been spoken of_ his lantern swung from his tightly clenched hand_ though the body was erect_ the head was thrown back so that the closed eyes were pointed towards the needle of the tell_tale that swung from a beam in the ceiling__ _the cabin_compass is called the tell_tale_ because without going to the compass at the helm_ the captain_ while below_ can inform himself of the course of the ship_ terrible old man_ thought starbuck with a shudder_ sleeping in this gale_ still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose_ chapter ___ the albatross_ south_eastward from the cape_ off the distant crozetts_ a good cruising ground for right whalemen_ a sail loomed ahead_ the goney _albatross_ by name_ as she slowly drew nigh_ from my lofty perch at the fore_mast_head_ i had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro in the far ocean fisheries_a whaler at sea_ and long absent from home_ as if the waves had been fullers_ this craft was bleached like the skeleton of a stranded walrus_ all down her sides_ this spectral appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust_ while all her spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred over with hoar_frost_ only her lower sails were set_ a wild sight it was to see her long_bearded look_outs at those three mast_heads_ they seemed clad in the skins of beasts_ so torn and bepatched the raiment that had survived nearly four years of cruising_ standing in iron hoops nailed to the mast_ they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea_ and though_ when the ship slowly glided close under our stern_ we six men in the air came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped from the mast_heads of one ship to those of the other_ yet_ those forlorn_looking fishermen_ mildly eyeing us as they passed_ said not one word to our own look_outs_ while the quarter_deck hail was being heard from below_ _ship ahoy_ have ye seen the white whale__ but as the strange captain_ leaning over the pallid bulwarks_ was in the act of putting his trumpet to his mouth_ it somehow fell from his hand into the sea_ and the wind now rising amain_ he in vain strove to make himself heard without it_ meantime his ship was still increasing the distance between_ while in various silent ways the seamen of the pequod were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the first mere mention of the white whale_s name to another ship_ ahab for a moment paused_ it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a boat to board the stranger_ had not the threatening wind forbade_ but taking advantage of his windward position_ he again seized his trumpet_ and knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a nantucketer and shortly bound home_ he loudly hailed__ahoy there_ this is the pequod_ bound round the world_ tell them to address all future letters to the pacific ocean_ and this time three years_ if i am not at home_ tell them to address them to__ at that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed_ and instantly_ then_ in accordance with their singular ways_ shoals of small harmless fish_ that for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side_ darted away with what seemed shuddering fins_ and ranged themselves fore and aft with the stranger_s flanks_ though in the course of his continual voyagings ahab must often before have noticed a similar sight_ yet_ to any monomaniac man_ the veriest trifles capriciously carry meanings_ _swim away from me_ do ye__ murmured ahab_ gazing over into the water_ there seemed but little in the words_ but the tone conveyed more of deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced_ but turning to the steersman_ who thus far had been holding the ship in the wind to diminish her headway_ he cried out in his old lion voice___up helm_ keep her off round the world__ round the world_ there is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings_ but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct_ only through numberless perils to the very point whence we started_ where those that we left behind secure_ were all the time before us_ were this world an endless plain_ and by sailing eastward we could for ever reach new distances_ and discover sights more sweet and strange than any cyclades or islands of king solomon_ then there were promise in the voyage_ but in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of_ or in tormented chase of that demon phantom that_ some time or other_ swims before all human hearts_ while chasing such over this round globe_ they either lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed_ chapter ___ the gam_ the ostensible reason why ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had spoken was this_ the wind and sea betokened storms_ but even had this not been the case_ he would not after all_ perhaps_ have boarded her_judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions_if so it had been that_ by the process of hailing_ he had obtained a negative answer to the question he put_ for_ as it eventually turned out_ he cared not to consort_ even for five minutes_ with any stranger captain_ except he could contribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought_ but all this might remain inadequately estimated_ were not something said here of the peculiar usages of whaling_vessels when meeting each other in foreign seas_ and especially on a common cruising_ground_ if two strangers crossing the pine barrens in new york state_ or the equally desolate salisbury plain in england_ if casually encountering each other in such inhospitable wilds_ these twain_ for the life of them_ cannot well avoid a mutual salutation_ and stopping for a moment to interchange the news_ and_ perhaps_ sitting down for a while and resting in concert_ then_ how much more natural that upon the illimitable pine barrens and salisbury plains of the sea_ two whaling vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth_off lone fanning_s island_ or the far away king_s mills_ how much more natural_ i say_ that under such circumstances these ships should not only interchange hails_ but come into still closer_ more friendly and sociable contact_ and especially would this seem to be a matter of course_ in the case of vessels owned in one seaport_ and whose captains_ officers_ and not a few of the men are personally known to each other_ and consequently_ have all sorts of dear domestic things to talk about_ for the long absent ship_ the outward_bounder_ perhaps_ has letters on board_ at any rate_ she will be sure to let her have some papers of a date a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and thumb_worn files_ and in return for that courtesy_ the outward_bound ship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the cruising_ground to which she may be destined_ a thing of the utmost importance to her_ and in degree_ all this will hold true concerning whaling vessels crossing each other_s track on the cruising_ground itself_ even though they are equally long absent from home_ for one of them may have received a transfer of letters from some third_ and now far remote vessel_ and some of those letters may be for the people of the ship she now meets_ besides_ they would exchange the whaling news_ and have an agreeable chat_ for not only would they meet with all the sympathies of sailors_ but likewise with all the peculiar congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared privations and perils_ nor would difference of country make any very essential difference_ that is_ so long as both parties speak one language_ as is the case with americans and english_ though_ to be sure_ from the small number of english whalers_ such meetings do not very often occur_ and when they do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them_ for your englishman is rather reserved_ and your yankee_ he does not fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself_ besides_ the english whalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the american whalers_ regarding the long_ lean nantucketer_ with his nondescript provincialisms_ as a sort of sea_peasant_ but where this superiority in the english whalemen does really consist_ it would be hard to say_ seeing that the yankees in one day_ collectively_ kill more whales than all the english_ collectively_ in ten years_ but this is a harmless little foible in the english whale_hunters_ which the nantucketer does not take much to heart_ probably_ because he knows that he has a few foibles himself_ so_ then_ we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea_ the whalers have most reason to be sociable_and they are so_ whereas_ some merchant ships crossing each other_s wake in the mid_atlantic_ will oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition_ mutually cutting each other on the high seas_ like a brace of dandies in broadway_ and all the time indulging_ perhaps_ in finical criticism upon each other_s rig_ as for men_of_war_ when they chance to meet at sea_ they first go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings_ such a ducking of ensigns_ that there does not seem to be much right_down hearty good_will and brotherly love about it at all_ as touching slave_ships meeting_ why_ they are in such a prodigious hurry_ they run away from each other as soon as possible_ and as for pirates_ when they chance to cross each other_s cross_bones_ the first hail is__how many skulls___the same way that whalers hail__how many barrels__ and that question once answered_ pirates straightway steer apart_ for they are infernal villains on both sides_ and don_t like to see overmuch of each other_s villanous likenesses_ but look at the godly_ honest_ unostentatious_ hospitable_ sociable_ free_and_easy whaler_ what does the whaler do when she meets another whaler in any sort of decent weather_ she has a _gam__ a thing so utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name even_ and if by chance they should hear of it_ they only grin at it_ and repeat gamesome stuff about _spouters_ and _blubber_boilers__ and such like pretty exclamations_ why it is that all merchant_seamen_ and also all pirates and man_of_war_s men_ and slave_ship sailors_ cherish such a scornful feeling towards whale_ships_ this is a question it would be hard to answer_ because_ in the case of pirates_ say_ i should like to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about it_ it sometimes ends in uncommon elevation_ indeed_ but only at the gallows_ and besides_ when a man is elevated in that odd fashion_ he has no proper foundation for his superior altitude_ hence_ i conclude_ that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman_ in that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on_ but what is a gam_ you might wear out your index_finger running up and down the columns of dictionaries_ and never find the word_ dr_ johnson never attained to that erudition_ noah webster_s ark does not hold it_ nevertheless_ this same expressive word has now for many years been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born yankees_ certainly_ it needs a definition_ and should be incorporated into the lexicon_ with that view_ let me learnedly define it_ gam_ noun_a social meeting of two _or more_ whaleships_ generally on a cruising_ground_ when_ after exchanging hails_ they exchange visits by boats_ crews_ the two captains remaining_ for the time_ on board of one ship_ and the two chief mates on the other_ there is another little item about gamming which must not be forgotten here_ all professions have their own little peculiarities of detail_ so has the whale fishery_ in a pirate_ man_of_war_ or slave ship_ when the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat_ he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable_ sometimes cushioned seat there_ and often steers himself with a pretty little milliner_s tiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons_ but the whale_boat has no seat astern_ no sofa of that sort whatever_ and no tiller at all_ high times indeed_ if whaling captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old aldermen in patent chairs_ and as for a tiller_ the whale_boat never admits of any such effeminacy_ and therefore as in gamming a complete boat_s crew must leave the ship_ and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number_ that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion_ and the captain_ having no place to sit in_ is pulled off to his visit all standing like a pine tree_ and often you will notice that being conscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him from the sides of the two ships_ this standing captain is all alive to the importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs_ nor is this any very easy matter_ for in his rear is the immense projecting steering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back_ the after_oar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front_ he is thus completely wedged before and behind_ and can only expand himself sideways by settling down on his stretched legs_ but a sudden_ violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him_ because length of foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth_ merely make a spread angle of two poles_ and you cannot stand them up_ then_ again_ it would never do in plain sight of the world_s riveted eyes_ it would never do_ i say_ for this straddling captain to be seen steadying himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his hands_ indeed_ as token of his entire_ buoyant self_command_ he generally carries his hands in his trowsers_ pockets_ but perhaps being generally very large_ heavy hands_ he carries them there for ballast_ nevertheless there have occurred instances_ well authenticated ones too_ where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment or two_ in a sudden squall say_to seize hold of the nearest oarsman_s hair_ and hold on there like grim death_ chapter ___ the town_ho_s story_ _as told at the golden inn_ the cape of good hope_ and all the watery region round about there_ is much like some noted four corners of a great highway_ where you meet more travellers than in any other part_ it was not very long after speaking the goney that another homeward_bound whaleman_ the town_ho__ was encountered_ she was manned almost wholly by polynesians_ in the short gam that ensued she gave us strong news of moby dick_ to some the general interest in the white whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the town_ho_s story_ which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain wondrous_ inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments of god which at times are said to overtake some men_ this latter circumstance_ with its own particular accompaniments_ forming what may be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated_ never reached the ears of captain ahab or his mates_ for that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain of the town_ho himself_ it was the private property of three confederate white seamen of that ship_ one of whom_ it seems_ communicated it to tashtego with romish injunctions of secrecy_ but the following night tashtego rambled in his sleep_ and revealed so much of it in that way_ that when he was wakened he could not well withhold the rest_ nevertheless_ so potent an influence did this thing have on those seamen in the pequod who came to the full knowledge of it_ and by such a strange delicacy_ to call it so_ were they governed in this matter_ that they kept the secret among themselves so that it never transpired abaft the pequod_s main_mast_ interweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the ship_ the whole of this strange affair i now proceed to put on lasting record_ _the ancient whale_cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast_head_ still used by whalemen in hunting the famous gallipagos terrapin_ for my humor_s sake_ i shall preserve the style in which i once narrated it at lima_ to a lounging circle of my spanish friends_ one saint_s eve_ smoking upon the thick_gilt tiled piazza of the golden inn_ of those fine cavaliers_ the young dons_ pedro and sebastian_ were on the closer terms with me_ and hence the interluding questions they occasionally put_ and which are duly answered at the time_ _some two years prior to my first learning the events which i am about rehearsing to you_ gentlemen_ the town_ho_ sperm whaler of nantucket_ was cruising in your pacific here_ not very many days_ sail eastward from the eaves of this good golden inn_ she was somewhere to the northward of the line_ one morning upon handling the pumps_ according to daily usage_ it was observed that she made more water in her hold than common_ they supposed a sword_fish had stabbed her_ gentlemen_ but the captain_ having some unusual reason for believing that rare good luck awaited him in those latitudes_ and therefore being very averse to quit them_ and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous_ though_ indeed_ they could not find it after searching the hold as low down as was possible in rather heavy weather_ the ship still continued her cruisings_ the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals_ but no good luck came_ more days went by_ and not only was the leak yet undiscovered_ but it sensibly increased_ so much so_ that now taking some alarm_ the captain_ making all sail_ stood away for the nearest harbor among the islands_ there to have his hull hove out and repaired_ _though no small passage was before her_ yet_ if the commonest chance favoured_ he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way_ because his pumps were of the best_ and being periodically relieved at them_ those six_and_thirty men of his could easily keep the ship free_ never mind if the leak should double on her_ in truth_ well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous breezes_ the town_ho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at her port without the occurrence of the least fatality_ had it not been for the brutal overbearing of radney_ the mate_ a vineyarder_ and the bitterly provoked vengeance of steelkilt_ a lakeman and desperado from buffalo_ __lakeman__buffalo_ pray_ what is a lakeman_ and where is buffalo__ said don sebastian_ rising in his swinging mat of grass_ _on the eastern shore of our lake erie_ don_ but_i crave your courtesy_may be_ you shall soon hear further of all that_ now_ gentlemen_ in square_sail brigs and three_masted ships_ well_nigh as large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old callao to far manilla_ this lakeman_ in the land_locked heart of our america_ had yet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly connected with the open ocean_ for in their interflowing aggregate_ those grand fresh_water seas of ours__erie_ and ontario_ and huron_ and superior_ and michigan__possess an ocean_like expansiveness_ with many of the ocean_s noblest traits_ with many of its rimmed varieties of races and of climes_ they contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles_ even as the polynesian waters do_ in large part_ are shored by two great contrasting nations_ as the atlantic is_ they furnish long maritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the east_ dotted all round their banks_ here and there are frowned upon by batteries_ and by the goat_like craggy guns of lofty mackinaw_ they have heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories_ at intervals_ they yield their beaches to wild barbarians_ whose red painted faces flash from out their peltry wigwams_ for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and unentered forests_ where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of kings in gothic genealogies_ those same woods harboring wild afric beasts of prey_ and silken creatures whose exported furs

they have drowned full many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew_ thus_ gentlemen_ though an inlander_ steelkilt was wild_ocean born_ and wild_ocean nurtured_ as much of an audacious mariner as any_ and for radney_ though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone nantucket beach_ to nurse at his maternal sea_ though in after life he had long followed our austere atlantic and your contemplative pacific_ yet was he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman_ fresh from the latitudes of buck_horn handled bowie_knives_ yet was this nantucketer a man with some good_hearted traits_ and this lakeman_ a mariner_ who though a sort of devil indeed_ might yet by inflexible firmness_ only tempered by that common decency of human recognition which is the meanest slave_s right_ thus treated_ this steelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile_ at all events_ he had proved so thus far_ but radney was doomed and made mad_ and steelkilt_but_ gentlemen_ you shall hear_ _it was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her prow for her island haven_ that the town_ho_s leak seemed again increasing_ but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps every day_ you must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our atlantic_ for example_ some skippers think little of pumping their whole way across it_ though of a still_ sleepy night_ should the officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect_ the probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it_ on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom_ nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward_ gentlemen_ is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their pump_handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length_ that is_ if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast_ or if any other reasonable retreat is afforded them_ it is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those waters_ some really landless latitude_ that her captain begins to feel a little anxious_ _much this way had it been with the town_ho_ so when her leak was found gaining once more_ there was in truth some small concern manifested by several of her company_ especially by radney the mate_ he commanded the upper sails to be well hoisted_ sheeted home anew_ and every way expanded to the breeze_ now this radney_ i suppose_ was as little of a coward_ and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless_ unthinking creature on land or on sea that you can conveniently imagine_ gentlemen_ therefore when he betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship_ some of the seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner in her_ so when they were working that evening at the pumps_ there was on this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them_ as they stood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear water_ clear as any mountain spring_ gentlemen_that bubbling from the pumps ran across the deck_ and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee scupper_holes_ _now_ as you well know_ it is not seldom the case in this conventional world of ours_watery or otherwise_ that when a person placed in command over his fellow_men finds one of them to be very significantly his superior in general pride of manhood_ straightway against that man he conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness_ and if he have a chance he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern_s tower_ and make a little heap of dust of it_ be this conceit of mine as it may_ gentlemen_ at all events steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a head like a roman_ and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housings of your last viceroy_s snorting charger_ and a brain_ and a heart_ and a soul in him_ gentlemen_ which had made steelkilt charlemagne_ had he been born son to charlemagne_s father_ but radney_ the mate_ was ugly as a mule_ yet as hardy_ as stubborn_ as malicious_ he did not love steelkilt_ and steelkilt knew it_ _espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the rest_ the lakeman affected not to notice him_ but unawed_ went on with his gay banterings_ __aye_ aye_ my merry lads_ it_s a lively leak this_ hold a cannikin_ one of ye_ and let_s have a taste_ by the lord_ it_s worth bottling_ i tell ye what_ men_ old rad_s investment must go for it_ he had best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home_ the fact is_ boys_ that sword_fish only began the job_ he_s come back again with a gang of ship_carpenters_ saw_fish_ and file_fish_ and what not_ and the whole posse of _em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom_ making improvements_ i suppose_ if old rad were here now_ i_d tell him to jump overboard and scatter _em_ they_re playing the devil with his estate_ i can tell him_ but he_s a simple old soul__rad_ and a beauty too_ boys_ they say the rest of his property is invested in looking_glasses_ i wonder if he_d give a poor devil like me the model of his nose__ __damn your eyes_ what_s that pump stopping for__ roared radney_ pretending not to have heard the sailors_ talk_ _thunder away at it__ __aye_ aye_ sir__ said steelkilt_ merry as a cricket_ _lively_ boys_ lively_ now__ and with that the pump clanged like fifty fire_engines_ the men tossed their hats off to it_ and ere long that peculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life_s utmost energies_ _quitting the pump at last_ with the rest of his band_ the lakeman went forward all panting_ and sat himself down on the windlass_ his face fiery red_ his eyes bloodshot_ and wiping the profuse sweat from his brow_ now what cozening fiend it was_ gentlemen_ that possessed radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state_ i know not_ but so it happened_ intolerably striding along the deck_ the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks_ and also a shovel_ and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large_ _now_ gentlemen_ sweeping a ship_s deck at sea is a piece of household work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every evening_ it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually foundering at the time_ such_ gentlemen_ is the inflexibility of sea_usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen_ some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing their faces_ but in all vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys_ if boys there be aboard_ besides_ it was the stronger men in the town_ho that had been divided into gangs_ taking turns at the pumps_ and being the most athletic seaman of them all_ steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of the gangs_ consequently he should have been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly nautical duties_ such being the case with his comrades_ i mention all these particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men_ _but there was more than this_ the order about the shovel was almost as plainly meant to sting and insult steelkilt_ as though radney had spat in his face_ any man who has gone sailor in a whale_ship will understand this_ and all this and doubtless much more_ the lakeman fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command_ but as he sat still for a moment_ and as he steadfastly looked into the mate_s malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder_casks heaped up in him and the slow_match silently burning along towards them_ as he instinctively saw all this_ that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful being_a repugnance most felt_ when felt at all_ by really valiant men even when aggrieved_this nameless phantom feeling_ gentlemen_ stole over steelkilt_ _therefore_ in his ordinary tone_ only a little broken by the bodily exhaustion he was temporarily in_ he answered him saying that sweeping the deck was not his business_ and he would not do it_ and then_ without at all alluding to the shovel_ he pointed to three lads as the customary sweepers_ who_ not being billeted at the pumps_ had done little or nothing all day_ to this_ radney replied with an oath_ in a most domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his command_ meanwhile advancing upon the still seated lakeman_ with an uplifted cooper_s club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near by_ _heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps_ for all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating steelkilt could but ill brook this bearing in the mate_ but somehow still smothering the conflagration within him_ without speaking he remained doggedly rooted to his seat_ till at last the incensed radney shook the hammer within a few inches of his face_ furiously commanding him to do his bidding_ _steelkilt rose_ and slowly retreating round the windlass_ steadily followed by the mate with his menacing hammer_ deliberately repeated his intention not to obey_ seeing_ however_ that his forbearance had not the slightest effect_ by an awful and unspeakable intimation with his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man_ but it was to no purpose_ and in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass_ when_ resolved at last no longer to retreat_ bethinking him that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor_ the lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer_ __mr_ radney_ i will not obey you_ take that hammer away_ or look to yourself__ but the predestinated mate coming still closer to him_ where the lakeman stood fixed_ now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of his teeth_ meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions_ retreating not the thousandth part of an inch_ stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his glance_ steelkilt_ clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back_ told his persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he _steelkilt_ would murder him_ but_ gentlemen_ the fool had been branded for the slaughter by the gods_ immediately the hammer touched the cheek_ the next instant the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head_ he fell on the hatch spouting blood like a whale_ _ere the cry could go aft steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their mastheads_ they were both canallers_ __canallers__ cried don pedro_ _we have seen many whale_ships in our harbours_ but never heard of your canallers_ pardon_ who and what are they__ __canallers_ don_ are the boatmen belonging to our grand erie canal_ you must have heard of it__ __nay_ senor_ hereabouts in this dull_ warm_ most lazy_ and hereditary land_ we know but little of your vigorous north__ __aye_ well then_ don_ refill my cup_ your chicha_s very fine_ and ere proceeding further i will tell ye what our canallers are_ for such information may throw side_light upon my story__ _for three hundred and sixty miles_ gentlemen_ through the entire breadth of the state of new york_ through numerous populous cities and most thriving villages_ through long_ dismal_ uninhabited swamps_ and affluent_ cultivated fields_ unrivalled for fertility_ by billiard_room and bar_room_ through the holy_of_holies of great forests_ on roman arches over indian rivers_ through sun and shade_ by happy hearts or broken_ through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble mohawk counties_ and especially_ by rows of snow_white chapels_ whose spires stand almost like milestones_ flows one continual stream of venetianly corrupt and often lawless life_ there_s your true ashantee_ gentlemen_ there howl your pagans_ where you ever find them_ next door to you_ under the long_flung shadow_ and the snug patronising lee of churches_ for by some curious fatality_ as it is often noted of your metropolitan freebooters that they ever encamp around the halls of justice_ so sinners_ gentlemen_ most abound in holiest vicinities_ __is that a friar passing__ said don pedro_ looking downwards into the crowded plazza_ with humorous concern_ __well for our northern friend_ dame isabella_s inquisition wanes in lima__ laughed don sebastian_ _proceed_ senor__ __a moment_ pardon__ cried another of the company_ _in the name of all us limeese_ i but desire to express to you_ sir sailor_ that we have by no means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present lima for distant venice in your corrupt comparison_ oh_ do not bow and look surprised_ you know the proverb all along this coast__corrupt as lima__ it but bears out your saying_ too_ churches more plentiful than billiard_tables_ and for ever open_and _corrupt as lima__ so_ too_ venice_ i have been there_ the holy city of the blessed evangelist_ st_ mark__st_ dominic_ purge it_ your cup_ thanks_ here i refill_ now_ you pour out again__ _freely depicted in his own vocation_ gentlemen_ the canaller would make a fine dramatic hero_ so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is he_ like mark antony_ for days and days along his green_turfed_ flowery nile_ he indolently floats_ openly toying with his red_cheeked cleopatra_ ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck_ but ashore_ all this effeminacy is dashed_ the brigandish guise which the canaller so proudly sports_ his slouched and gaily_ribboned hat betoken his grand features_ a terror to the smiling innocence of the villages through which he floats_ his swart visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities_ once a vagabond on his own canal_ i have received good turns from one of these canallers_ i thank him heartily_ would fain be not ungrateful_ but it is often one of the prime redeeming qualities of your man of violence_ that at times he has as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger in a strait_ as to plunder a wealthy one_ in sum_ gentlemen_ what the wildness of this canal life is_ is emphatically evinced by this_ that our wild whale_fishery contains so many of its most finished graduates_ and that scarce any race of mankind_ except sydney men_ are so much distrusted by our whaling captains_ nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter_ that to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its line_ the probationary life of the grand canal furnishes the sole transition between quietly reaping in a christian corn_field_ and recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas_ __i see_ i see__ impetuously exclaimed don pedro_ spilling his chicha upon his silvery ruffles_ _no need to travel_ the world_s one lima_ i had thought_ now_ that at your temperate north the generations were cold and holy as the hills__but the story__ _i left off_ gentlemen_ where the lakeman shook the backstay_ hardly had he done so_ when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and the four harpooneers_ who all crowded him to the deck_ but sliding down the ropes like baleful comets_ the two canallers rushed into the uproar_ and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle_ others of the sailors joined with them in this attempt_ and a twisted turmoil ensued_ while standing out of harm_s way_ the valiant captain danced up and down with a whale_pike_ calling upon his officers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel_ and smoke him along to the quarter_deck_ at intervals_ he ran close up to the revolving border of the confusion_ and prying into the heart of it with his pike_ sought to prick out the object of his resentment_ but steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all_ they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck_ where_ hastily slewing about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass_ these sea_parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade_ __come out of that_ ye pirates__ roared the captain_ now menacing them with a pistol in each hand_ just brought to him by the steward_ _come out of that_ ye cut_throats__ _steelkilt leaped on the barricade_ and striding up and down there_ defied the worst the pistols could do_ but gave the captain to understand distinctly_ that his _steelkilt_s_ death would be the signal for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands_ fearing in his heart lest this might prove but too true_ the captain a little desisted_ but still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty_ __will you promise not to touch us_ if we do__ demanded their ringleader_ __turn to_ turn to__i make no promise__to your duty_ do you want to sink the ship_ by knocking off at a time like this_ turn to__ and he once more raised a pistol_ __sink the ship__ cried steelkilt_ _aye_ let her sink_ not a man of us turns to_ unless you swear not to raise a rope_yarn against us_ what say ye_ men__ turning to his comrades_ a fierce cheer was their response_ _the lakeman now patrolled the barricade_ all the while keeping his eye on the captain_ and jerking out such sentences as these___it_s not our fault_ we didn_t want it_ i told him to take his hammer away_ it was boy_s business_ he might have known me before this_ i told him not to prick the buffalo_ i believe i have broken a finger here against his cursed jaw_ ain_t those mincing knives down in the forecastle there_ men_ look to those handspikes_ my hearties_ captain_ by god_ look to yourself_ say the word_ don_t be a fool_ forget it all_ we are ready to turn to_ treat us decently_ and we_re your men_ but we won_t be flogged__ __turn to_ i make no promises_ turn to_ i say__ __look ye_ now__ cried the lakeman_ flinging out his arm towards him_ _there are a few of us here _and i am one of them_ who have shipped for the cruise_ d_ye see_ now as you well know_ sir_ we can claim our discharge as soon as the anchor is down_ so we don_t want a row_ it_s not our interest_ we want to be peaceable_ we are ready to work_ but we won_t be flogged__ __turn to__ roared the captain_ _steelkilt glanced round him a moment_ and then said___i tell you what it is now_ captain_ rather than kill ye_ and be hung for such a shabby rascal_ we won_t lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us_ but till you say the word about not flogging us_ we don_t do a hand_s turn__ __down into the forecastle then_ down with ye_ i_ll keep ye there till ye_re sick of it_ down ye go__ __shall we__ cried the ringleader to his men_ most of them were against it_ but at length_ in obedience to steelkilt_ they preceded him down into their dark den_ growlingly disappearing_ like bears into a cave_ _as the lakeman_s bare head was just level with the planks_ the captain and his posse leaped the barricade_ and rapidly drawing over the slide of the scuttle_ planted their group of hands upon it_ and loudly called for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the companionway_ _then opening the slide a little_ the captain whispered something down the crack_ closed it_ and turned the key upon them_ten in number_leaving on deck some twenty or more_ who thus far had remained neutral_ _all night a wide_awake watch was kept by all the officers_ forward and aft_ especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway_ at which last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge_ after breaking through the bulkhead below_ but the hours of darkness passed in peace_ the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the pumps_ whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary night dismally resounded through the ship_ _at sunrise the captain went forward_ and knocking on the deck_ summoned the prisoners to work_ but with a yell they refused_ water was then lowered down to them_ and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were tossed after it_ when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it_ the captain returned to the quarter_deck_ twice every day for three days this was repeated_ but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling_ and then a scuffling was heard_ as the customary summons was delivered_ and suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle_ saying they were ready to turn to_ the fetid closeness of the air_ and a famishing diet_ united perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution_ had constrained them to surrender at discretion_ emboldened by this_ the captain reiterated his demand to the rest_ but steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged_ on the fifth morning three others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the desperate arms below that sought to restrain them_ only three were left_ __better turn to_ now__ said the captain with a heartless jeer_ __shut us up again_ will ye__ cried steelkilt_ __oh certainly__ said the captain_ and the key clicked_ _it was at this point_ gentlemen_ that enraged by the defection of seven of his former associates_ and stung by the mocking voice that had last hailed him_ and maddened by his long entombment in a place as black as the bowels of despair_ it was then that steelkilt proposed to the two canallers_ thus far apparently of one mind with him_ to burst out of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison_ and armed with their keen mincing knives _long_ crescentic_ heavy implements with a handle at each end_ run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail_ and if by any devilishness of desperation possible_ seize the ship_ for himself_ he would do this_ he said_ whether they joined him or not_ that was the last night he should spend in that den_ but the scheme met with no opposition on the part of the other two_ they swore they were ready for that_ or for any other mad thing_ for anything in short but a surrender_ and what was more_ they each insisted upon being the first man on deck_ when the time to make the rush should come_ but to this their leader as fiercely objected_ reserving that priority for himself_ particularly as his two comrades would not yield_ the one to the other_ in the matter_ and both of them could not be first_ for the ladder would but admit one man at a time_ and here_ gentlemen_ the foul play of these miscreants must come out_ _upon hearing the frantic project of their leader_ each in his own separate soul had suddenly lighted_ it would seem_ upon the same piece of treachery_ namely_ to be foremost in breaking out_ in order to be the first of the three_ though the last of the ten_ to surrender_ and thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might merit_ but when steelkilt made known his determination still to lead them to the last_ they in some way_ by some subtle chemistry of villany_ mixed their before secret treacheries together_ and when their leader fell into a doze_ verbally opened their souls to each other in three sentences_ and bound the sleeper with cords_ and gagged him with cords_ and shrieked out for the captain at midnight_ _thinking murder at hand_ and smelling in the dark for the blood_ he and all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle_ in a few minutes the scuttle was opened_ and_ bound hand and foot_ the still struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious allies_ who at once claimed the honour of securing a man who had been fully ripe for murder_ but all these were collared_ and dragged along the deck like dead cattle_ and_ side by side_ were seized up into the mizzen rigging_ like three quarters of meat_ and there they hung till morning_ _damn ye__ cried the captain_ pacing to and fro before them_ _the vultures would not touch ye_ ye villains__ _at sunrise he summoned all hands_ and separating those who had rebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny_ he told the former that he had a good mind to flog them all round_thought_ upon the whole_ he would do so_he ought to_justice demanded it_ but for the present_ considering their timely surrender_ he would let them go with a reprimand_ which he accordingly administered in the vernacular_ __but as for you_ ye carrion rogues__ turning to the three men in the rigging__for you_ i mean to mince ye up for the try_pots__ and_ seizing a rope_ he applied it with all his might to the backs of the two traitors_ till they yelled no more_ but lifelessly hung their heads sideways_ as the two crucified thieves are drawn_ __my wrist is sprained with ye__ he cried_ at last_ _but there is still rope enough left for you_ my fine bantam_ that wouldn_t give up_ take that gag from his mouth_ and let us hear what he can say for himself__ _for a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his cramped jaws_ and then painfully twisting round his head_ said in a sort of hiss_ _what i say is this_and mind it well_if you flog me_ i murder you__ __say ye so_ then see how ye frighten me__and the captain drew off with the rope to strike_ __best not__ hissed the lakeman_ __but i must___and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke_ _steelkilt here hissed out something_ inaudible to all but the captain_ who_ to the amazement of all hands_ started back_ paced the deck rapidly two or three times_ and then suddenly throwing down his rope_ said_ _i won_t do it_let him go_cut him down_ d_ye hear__ _but as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order_ a pale man_ with a bandaged head_ arrested them_radney the chief mate_ ever since the blow_ he had lain in his berth_ but that morning_ hearing the tumult on the deck_ he had crept out_ and thus far had watched the whole scene_ such was the state of his mouth_ that he could hardly speak_ but mumbling something about his being willing and able to do what the captain dared not attempt_ he snatched the rope and advanced to his pinioned foe_ __you are a coward__ hissed the lakeman_ __so i am_ but take that__ the mate was in the very act of striking_ when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm_ he paused_ and then pausing no more_ made good his word_ spite of steelkilt_s threat_ whatever that might have been_ the three men were then cut down_ all hands were turned to_ and_ sullenly worked by the moody seamen_ the iron pumps clanged as before_ _just after dark that day_ when one watch had retired below_ a clamor was heard in the forecastle_ and the two trembling traitors running up_ besieged the cabin door_ saying they durst not consort with the crew_ entreaties_ cuffs_ and kicks could not drive them back_ so at their own instance they were put down in the ship_s run for salvation_ still_ no sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest_ on the contrary_ it seemed_ that mainly at steelkilt_s instigation_ they had resolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness_ obey all orders to the last_ and_ when the ship reached port_ desert her in a body_ but in order to insure the speediest end to the voyage_ they all agreed to another thing_namely_ not to sing out for whales_ in case any should be discovered_ for_ spite of her leak_ and spite of all her other perils_ the town_ho still maintained her mast_heads_ and her captain was just as willing to lower for a fish that moment_ as on the day his craft first struck the cruising ground_ and radney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat_ and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale_ _but though the lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of passiveness in their conduct_ he kept his own counsel _at least till all was over_ concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart_ he was in radney the chief mate_s watch_ and as if the infatuated man sought to run more than half way to meet his doom_ after the scene at the rigging_ he insisted_ against the express counsel of the captain_ upon resuming the head of his watch at night_ upon this_ and one or two other circumstances_ steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge_ _during the night_ radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the bulwarks of the quarter_deck_ and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of the boat which was hoisted up there_ a little above the ship_s side_ in this attitude_ it was well known_ he sometimes dozed_ there was a considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship_ and down between this was the sea_ steelkilt calculated his time_ and found that his next trick at the helm would come round at two o_clock_ in the morning of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed_ at his leisure_ he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully in his watches below_ __what are you making there__ said a shipmate_ __what do you think_ what does it look like__ __like a lanyard for your bag_ but it_s an odd one_ seems to me__ __yes_ rather oddish__ said the lakeman_ holding it at arm_s length before him_ _but i think it will answer_ shipmate_ i haven_t enough twine__have you any__ _but there was none in the forecastle_ __then i must get some from old rad__ and he rose to go aft_ __you don_t mean to go a begging to him__ said a sailor_ __why not_ do you think he won_t do me a turn_ when it_s to help himself in the end_ shipmate__ and going to the mate_ he looked at him quietly_ and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock_ it was given him_neither twine nor lanyard were seen again_ but the next night an iron ball_ closely netted_ partly rolled from the pocket of the lakeman_s monkey jacket_ as he was tucking the coat into his hammock for a pillow_ twenty_four hours after_ his trick at the silent helm_nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready dug to the seaman_s hand_that fatal hour was then to come_ and in the fore_ordaining soul of steelkilt_ the mate was already stark and stretched as a corpse_ with his forehead crushed in_ _but_ gentlemen_ a fool saved the would_be murderer from the bloody deed he had planned_ yet complete revenge he had_ and without being the avenger_ for by a mysterious fatality_ heaven itself seemed to step in to take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have done_ _it was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second day_ when they were washing down the decks_ that a stupid teneriffe man_ drawing water in the main_chains_ all at once shouted out_ _there she rolls_ there she rolls__ jesu_ what a whale_ it was moby dick_ __moby dick__ cried don sebastian_ _st_ dominic_ sir sailor_ but do whales have christenings_ whom call you moby dick__ __a very white_ and famous_ and most deadly immortal monster_ don__but that would be too long a story__ __how_ how__ cried all the young spaniards_ crowding_ __nay_ dons_ dons_nay_ nay_ i cannot rehearse that now_ let me get more into the air_ sirs__ __the chicha_ the chicha__ cried don pedro_ _our vigorous friend looks faint__fill up his empty glass__ _no need_ gentlemen_ one moment_ and i proceed__now_ gentlemen_ so suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the ship_forgetful of the compact among the crew_in the excitement of the moment_ the teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted his voice for the monster_ though for some little time past it had been plainly beheld from the three sullen mast_heads_ all was now a phrensy_ _the white whale_the white whale__ was the cry from captain_ mates_ and harpooneers_ who_ undeterred by fearful rumours_ were all anxious to capture so famous and precious a fish_ while the dogged crew eyed askance_ and with curses_ the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass_ that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun_ shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue morning sea_ gentlemen_ a strange fatality pervades the whole career of these events_ as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted_ the mutineer was the bowsman of the mate_ and when fast to a fish_ it was his duty to sit next him_ while radney stood up with his lance in the prow_ and haul in or slacken the line_ at the word of command_ moreover_ when the four boats were lowered_ the mate_s got the start_ and none howled more fiercely with delight than did steelkilt_ as he strained at his oar_ after a stiff pull_ their harpooneer got fast_ and_ spear in hand_ radney sprang to the bow_ he was always a furious man_ it seems_ in a boat_ and now his bandaged cry was_ to beach him on the whale_s topmost back_ nothing loath_ his bowsman hauled him up and up_ through a blinding foam that blent two whitenesses together_ till of a sudden the boat struck as against a sunken ledge_ and keeling over_ spilled out the standing mate_ that instant_ as he fell on the whale_s slippery back_ the boat righted_ and was dashed aside by the swell_ while radney was tossed over into the sea_ on the other flank of the whale_ he struck out through the spray_ and_ for an instant_ was dimly seen through that veil_ wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of moby dick_ but the whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom_ seized the swimmer between his jaws_ and rearing high up with him_ plunged headlong again_ and went down_ _meantime_ at the first tap of the boat_s bottom_ the lakeman had slackened the line_ so as to drop astern from the whirlpool_ calmly looking on_ he thought his own thoughts_ but a sudden_ terrific_ downward jerking of the boat_ quickly brought his knife to the line_ he cut it_ and the whale was free_ but_ at some distance_ moby dick rose again_ with some tatters of radney_s red woollen shirt_ caught in the teeth that had destroyed him_ all four boats gave chase again_ but the whale eluded them_ and finally wholly disappeared_ _in good time_ the town_ho reached her port_a savage_ solitary place_where no civilized creature resided_ there_ headed by the lakeman_ all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted among the palms_ eventually_ as it turned out_ seizing a large double war_canoe of the savages_ and setting sail for some other harbor_ _the ship_s company being reduced to but a handful_ the captain called upon the islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving down the ship to stop the leak_ but to such unresting vigilance over their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated_ both by night and by day_ and so extreme was the hard work they underwent_ that upon the vessel being ready again for sea_ they were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel_ after taking counsel with his officers_ he anchored the ship as far off shore as possible_ loaded and ran out his two cannon from the bows_ stacked his muskets on the poop_ and warning the islanders not to approach the ship at their peril_ took one man with him_ and setting the sail of his best whale_boat_ steered straight before the wind for tahiti_ five hundred miles distant_ to procure a reinforcement to his crew_ _on the fourth day of the sail_ a large canoe was descried_ which seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals_ he steered away from it_ but the savage craft bore down on him_ and soon the voice of steelkilt hailed him to heave to_ or he would run him under water_ the captain presented a pistol_ with one foot on each prow of the yoked war_canoes_ the lakeman laughed him to scorn_ assuring him that if the pistol so much as clicked in the lock_ he would bury him in bubbles and foam_ __what do you want of me__ cried the captain_ __where are you bound_ and for what are you bound__ demanded steelkilt_ _no lies__ __i am bound to tahiti for more men__ __very good_ let me board you a moment_i come in peace__ with that he leaped from the canoe_ swam to the boat_ and climbing the gunwale_ stood face to face with the captain_ __cross your arms_ sir_ throw back your head_ now_ repeat after me_ as soon as steelkilt leaves me_ i swear to beach this boat on yonder island_ and remain there six days_ if i do not_ may lightning strike me__ __a pretty scholar__ laughed the lakeman_ _adios_ senor__ and leaping into the sea_ he swam back to his comrades_ _watching the boat till it was fairly beached_ and drawn up to the roots of the cocoa_nut trees_ steelkilt made sail again_ and in due time arrived at tahiti_ his own place of destination_ there_ luck befriended him_ two ships were about to sail for france_ and were providentially in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor headed_ they embarked_ and so for ever got the start of their former captain_ had he been at all minded to work them legal retribution_ _some ten days after the french ships sailed_ the whale_boat arrived_ and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized tahitians_ who had been somewhat used to the sea_ chartering a small native schooner_ he returned with them to his vessel_ and finding all right there_ again resumed his cruisings_ _where steelkilt now is_ gentlemen_ none know_ but upon the island of nantucket_ the widow of radney still turns to the sea which refuses to give up its dead_ still in dreams sees the awful white whale that destroyed him_ __are you through__ said don sebastian_ quietly_ __i am_ don__ __then i entreat you_ tell me if to the best of your own convictions_ this your story is in substance really true_ it is so passing wonderful_ did you get it from an unquestionable source_ bear with me if i seem to press__ __also bear with all of us_ sir sailor_ for we all join in don sebastian_s suit__ cried the company_ with exceeding interest_ __is there a copy of the holy evangelists in the golden inn_ gentlemen__ __nay__ said don sebastian_ _but i know a worthy priest near by_ who will quickly procure one for me_ i go for it_ but are you well advised_ this may grow too serious__ __will you be so good as to bring the priest also_ don__ __though there are no auto_da_fe_s in lima now__ said one of the company to another_ _i fear our sailor friend runs risk of the archiepiscopacy_ let us withdraw more out of the moonlight_ i see no need of this__ __excuse me for running after you_ don sebastian_ but may i also beg that you will be particular in procuring the largest sized evangelists you can__ __this is the priest_ he brings you the evangelists__ said don sebastian_ gravely_ returning with a tall and solemn figure_ __let me remove my hat_ now_ venerable priest_ further into the light_ and hold the holy book before me that i may touch it_ __so help me heaven_ and on my honour the story i have told ye_ gentlemen_ is in substance and its great items_ true_ i know it to be true_ it happened on this ball_ i trod the ship_ i knew the crew_ i have seen and talked with steelkilt since the death of radney___ chapter ___ of the monstrous pictures of whales_ i shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas_ something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored alongside the whale_ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there_ it may be worth while_ therefore_ previously to advert to those curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to the present day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman_ it is time to set the world right in this matter_ by proving such pictures of the whale all wrong_ it may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will be found among the oldest hindoo_ egyptian_ and grecian sculptures_ for ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble panellings of temples_ the pedestals of statues_ and on shields_ medallions_ cups_ and coins_ the dolphin was drawn in scales of chain_armor like saladin_s_ and a helmeted head like st_ george_s_ ever since then has something of the same sort of license prevailed_ not only in most popular pictures of the whale_ but in many scientific presentations of him_ now_ by all odds_ the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting to be the whale_s_ is to be found in the famous cavern_pagoda of elephanta_ in india_ the brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda_ all the trades and pursuits_ every conceivable avocation of man_ were prefigured ages before any of them actually came into being_ no wonder then_ that in some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth_ the hindoo whale referred to_ occurs in a separate department of the wall_ depicting the incarnation of vishnu in the form of leviathan_ learnedly known as the matse avatar_ but though this sculpture is half man and half whale_ so as only to give the tail of the latter_ yet that small section of him is all wrong_ it looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda_ than the broad palms of the true whale_s majestic flukes_ but go to the old galleries_ and look now at a great christian painter_s portrait of this fish_ for he succeeds no better than the antediluvian hindoo_ it is guido_s picture of perseus rescuing andromeda from the sea_monster or whale_ where did guido get the model of such a strange creature as that_ nor does hogarth_ in painting the same scene in his own _perseus descending__ make out one whit better_ the huge corpulence of that hogarthian monster undulates on the surface_ scarcely drawing one inch of water_ it has a sort of howdah on its back_ and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows are rolling_ might be taken for the traitors_ gate leading from the thames by water into the tower_ then_ there are the prodromus whales of old scotch sibbald_ and jonah_s whale_ as depicted in the prints of old bibles and the cuts of old primers_ what shall be said of these_ as for the book_binder_s whale winding like a vine_stalk round the stock of a descending anchor_as stamped and gilded on the backs and title_pages of many books both old and new_that is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature_ imitated_ i take it_ from the like figures on antique vases_ though universally denominated a dolphin_ i nevertheless call this book_binder_s fish an attempt at a whale_ because it was so intended when the device was first introduced_ it was introduced by an old italian publisher somewhere about the __th century_ during the revival of learning_ and in those days_ and even down to a comparatively late period_ dolphins were popularly supposed to be a species of the leviathan_ in the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you will at times meet with very curious touches at the whale_ where all manner of spouts_ jets d_eau_ hot springs and cold_ saratoga and baden_baden_ come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain_ in the title_page of the original edition of the _advancement of learning_ you will find some curious whales_ but quitting all these unprofessional attempts_ let us glance at those pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober_ scientific delineations_ by those who know_ in old harris_s collection of voyages there are some plates of whales extracted from a dutch book of voyages_ a_d_ _____ entitled _a whaling voyage to spitzbergen in the ship jonas in the whale_ peter peterson of friesland_ master__ in one of those plates the whales_ like great rafts of logs_ are represented lying among ice_isles_ with white bears running over their living backs_ in another plate_ the prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with perpendicular flukes_ then again_ there is an imposing quarto_ written by one captain colnett_ a post captain in the english navy_ entitled _a voyage round cape horn into the south seas_ for the purpose of extending the spermaceti whale fisheries__ in this book is an outline purporting to be a _picture of a physeter or spermaceti whale_ drawn by scale from one killed on the coast of mexico_ august_ _____ and hoisted on deck__ i doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for the benefit of his marines_ to mention but one thing about it_ let me say that it has an eye which applied_ according to the accompanying scale_ to a full grown sperm whale_ would make the eye of that whale a bow_window some five feet long_ ah_ my gallant captain_ why did ye not give us jonah looking out of that eye_ nor are the most conscientious compilations of natural history for the benefit of the young and tender_ free from the same heinousness of mistake_ look at that popular work _goldsmith_s animated nature__ in the abridged london edition of _____ there are plates of an alleged _whale_ and a _narwhale__ i do not wish to seem inelegant_ but this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow_ and_ as for the narwhale_ one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one_ that in this nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any intelligent public of schoolboys_ then_ again_ in _____ bernard germain_ count de lacepede_ a great naturalist_ published a scientific systemized whale book_ wherein are several pictures of the different species of the leviathan_ all these are not only incorrect_ but the picture of the mysticetus or greenland whale _that is to say_ the right whale__ even scoresby_ a long experienced man as touching that species_ declares not to have its counterpart in nature_ but the placing of the cap_sheaf to all this blundering business was reserved for the scientific frederick cuvier_ brother to the famous baron_ in _____ he published a natural history of whales_ in which he gives what he calls a picture of the sperm whale_ before showing that picture to any nantucketer_ you had best provide for your summary retreat from nantucket_ in a word_ frederick cuvier_s sperm whale is not a sperm whale_ but a squash_ of course_ he never had the benefit of a whaling voyage _such men seldom have__ but whence he derived that picture_ who can tell_ perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor in the same field_ desmarest_ got one of his authentic abortions_ that is_ from a chinese drawing_ and what sort of lively lads with the pencil those chinese are_ many queer cups and saucers inform us_ as for the sign_painters_ whales seen in the streets hanging over the shops of oil_dealers_ what shall be said of them_ they are generally richard iii_ whales_ with dromedary humps_ and very savage_ breakfasting on three or four sailor tarts_ that is whaleboats full of mariners_ their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue paint_ but these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very surprising after all_ consider_ most of the scientific drawings have been taken from the stranded fish_ and these are about as correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship_ with broken back_ would correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars_ though elephants have stood for their full_lengths_ the living leviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait_ the living whale_ in his full majesty and significance_ is only to be seen at sea in unfathomable waters_ and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight_ like a launched line_of_battle ship_ and out of that element it is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air_ so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations_ and_ not to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour between a young sucking whale and a full_grown platonian leviathan_ yet_ even in the case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship_s deck_ such is then the outlandish_ eel_like_ limbered_ varying shape of him_ that his precise expression the devil himself could not catch_ but it may be fancied_ that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale_ accurate hints may be derived touching his true form_ not at all_ for it is one of the more curious things about this leviathan_ that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape_ though jeremy bentham_s skeleton_ which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of his executors_ correctly conveys the idea of a burly_browed utilitarian old gentleman_ with all jeremy_s other leading personal characteristics_ yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan_s articulated bones_ in fact_ as the great hunter says_ the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it_ this peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head_ as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown_ it is also very curiously displayed in the side fin_ the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand_ minus only the thumb_ this fin has four regular bone_fingers_ the index_ middle_ ring_ and little finger_ but all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering_ as the human fingers in an artificial covering_ _however recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us__ said humorous stubb one day_ _he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens__ for all these reasons_ then_ any way you may look at it_ you must needs conclude that the great leviathan is that one creature in the world which must remain unpainted to the last_ true_ one portrait may hit the mark much nearer than another_ but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of exactness_ so there is no earthly way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like_ and the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour_ is by going a whaling yourself_ but by so doing_ you run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him_ wherefore_ it seems to me you had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this leviathan_ chapter ___ of the less erroneous pictures of whales_ and the true pictures of whaling scenes_ in connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales_ i am strongly tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them which are to be found in certain books_ both ancient and modern_ especially in pliny_ purchas_ hackluyt_ harris_ cuvier_ etc_ but i pass that matter by_ i know of only four published outlines of the great sperm whale_ colnett_s_ huggins_s_ frederick cuvier_s_ and beale_s_ in the previous chapter colnett and cuvier have been referred to_ huggins_s is far better than theirs_ but_ by great odds_ beale_s is the best_ all beale_s drawings of this whale are good_ excepting the middle figure in the picture of three whales in various attitudes_ capping his second chapter_ his frontispiece_ boats attacking sperm whales_ though no doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men_ is admirably correct and life_like in its general effect_ some of the sperm whale drawings in j_ ross browne are pretty correct in contour_ but they are wretchedly engraved_ that is not his fault though_ of the right whale_ the best outline pictures are in scoresby_ but they are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression_ he has but one picture of whaling scenes_ and this is a sad deficiency_ because it is by such pictures only_ when at all well done_ that you can derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by his living hunters_ but_ taken for all in all_ by far the finest_ though in some details not the most correct_ presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be anywhere found_ are two large french engravings_ well executed_ and taken from paintings by one garnery_ respectively_ they represent attacks on the sperm and right whale_ in the first engraving a noble sperm whale is depicted in full majesty of might_ just risen beneath the boat from the profundities of the ocean_ and bearing high in the air upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks_ the prow of the boat is partially unbroken_ and is drawn just balancing upon the monster_s spine_ and standing in that prow_ for that one single incomputable flash of time_ you behold an oarsman_ half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the whale_ and in the act of leaping_ as if from a precipice_ the action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and true_ the half_emptied line_tub floats on the whitened sea_ the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it_ the heads of the swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions of affright_ while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene_ serious fault might be found with the anatomical details of this whale_ but let that pass_ since_ for the life of me_ i could not draw so good a one_ in the second engraving_ the boat is in the act of drawing alongside the barnacled flank of a large running right whale_ that rolls his black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock_slide from the patagonian cliffs_ his jets are erect_ full_ and black like soot_ so that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney_ you would think there must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below_ sea fowls are pecking at the small crabs_ shell_fish_ and other sea candies and maccaroni_ which the right whale sometimes carries on his pestilent back_ and all the while the thick_lipped leviathan is rushing through the deep_ leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake_ and causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught nigh the paddle_wheels of an ocean steamer_ thus_ the foreground is all raging commotion_ but behind_ in admirable artistic contrast_ is the glassy level of a sea becalmed_ the drooping unstarched sails of the powerless ship_ and the inert mass of a dead whale_ a conquered fortress_ with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whale_pole inserted into his spout_hole_ who garnery the painter is_ or was_ i know not_ but my life for it he was either practically conversant with his subject_ or else marvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman_ the french are the lads for painting action_ go and gaze upon all the paintings of europe_ and where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing commotion on canvas_ as in that triumphal hall at versailles_ where the beholder fights his way_ pell_mell_ through the consecutive great battles of france_ where every sword seems a flash of the northern lights_ and the successive armed kings and emperors dash by_ like a charge of crowned centaurs_ not wholly unworthy of a place in that gallery_ are these sea battle_pieces of garnery_ the natural aptitude of the french for seizing the picturesqueness of things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings they have of their whaling scenes_ with not one tenth of england_s experience in the fishery_ and not the thousandth part of that of the americans_ they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the whale hunt_ for the most part_ the english and american whale draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline of things_ such as the vacant profile of the whale_ which_ so far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned_ is about tantamount to sketching the profile of a pyramid_ even scoresby_ the justly renowned right whaleman_ after giving us a stiff full length of the greenland whale_ and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and porpoises_ treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks_ chopping knives_ and grapnels_ and with the microscopic diligence of a leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninety_six fac_similes of magnified arctic snow crystals_ i mean no disparagement to the excellent voyager _i honour him for a veteran__ but in so important a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured for every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a greenland justice of the peace_ in addition to those fine engravings from garnery_ there are two other french engravings worthy of note_ by some one who subscribes himself _h_ durand__ one of them_ though not precisely adapted to our present purpose_ nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts_ it is a quiet noon_scene among the isles of the pacific_ a french whaler anchored_ inshore_ in a calm_ and lazily taking water on board_ the loosened sails of the ship_ and the long leaves of the palms in the background_ both drooping together in the breezeless air_ the effect is very fine_ when considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen under one of their few aspects of oriental repose_ the other engraving is quite a different affair_ the ship hove_to upon the open sea_ and in the very heart of the leviathanic life_ with a right whale alongside_ the vessel _in the act of cutting_in_ hove over to the monster as if to a quay_ and a boat_ hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity_ is about giving chase to whales in the distance_ the harpoons and lances lie levelled for use_ three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its hole_ while from a sudden roll of the sea_ the little craft stands half_erect out of the water_ like a rearing horse_ from the ship_ the smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke over a village of smithies_ and to windward_ a black cloud_ rising up with earnest of squalls and rains_ seems to quicken the activity of the excited seamen_ chapter ___ of whales in paint_ in teeth_ in wood_ in sheet_iron_ in stone_ in mountains_ in stars_ on tower_hill_ as you go down to the london docks_ you may have seen a crippled beggar _or kedger_ as the sailors say_ holding a painted board before him_ representing the tragic scene in which he lost his leg_ there are three whales and three boats_ and one of the boats _presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity_ is being crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale_ any time these ten years_ they tell me_ has that man held up that picture_ and exhibited that stump to an incredulous world_ but the time of his justification has now come_ his three whales are as good whales as were ever published in wapping_ at any rate_ and his stump as unquestionable a stump as any you will find in the western clearings_ but_ though for ever mounted on that stump_ never a stump_speech does the poor whaleman make_ but_ with downcast eyes_ stands ruefully contemplating his own amputation_ throughout the pacific_ and also in nantucket_ and new bedford_ and sag harbor_ you will come across lively sketches of whales and whaling_scenes_ graven by the fishermen themselves on sperm whale_teeth_ or ladies_ busks wrought out of the right whale_bone_ and other like skrimshander articles_ as the whalemen call the numerous little ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of the rough material_ in their hours of ocean leisure_ some of them have little boxes of dentistical_looking implements_ specially intended for the skrimshandering business_ but_ in general_ they toil with their jack_knives alone_ and_ with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor_ they will turn you out anything you please_ in the way of a mariner_s fancy_ long exile from christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man to that condition in which god placed him_ i_e_ what is called savagery_ your true whale_hunter is as much a savage as an iroquois_ i myself am a savage_ owning no allegiance but to the king of the cannibals_ and ready at any moment to rebel against him_ now_ one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic hours_ is his wonderful patience of industry_ an ancient hawaiian war_club or spear_paddle_ in its full multiplicity and elaboration of carving_ is as great a trophy of human perseverance as a latin lexicon_ for_ with but a bit of broken sea_shell or a shark_s tooth_ that miraculous intricacy of wooden net_work has been achieved_ and it has cost steady years of steady application_ as with the hawaiian savage_ so with the white sailor_savage_ with the same marvellous patience_ and with the same single shark_s tooth_ of his one poor jack_knife_ he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture_ not quite as workmanlike_ but as close packed in its maziness of design_ as the greek savage_ achilles_s shield_ and full of barbaric spirit and suggestiveness_ as the prints of that fine old dutch savage_ albert durer_ wooden whales_ or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of the noble south sea war_wood_ are frequently met with in the forecastles of american whalers_ some of them are done with much accuracy_ at some old gable_roofed country houses you will see brass whales hung by the tail for knockers to the road_side door_ when the porter is sleepy_ the anvil_headed whale would be best_ but these knocking whales are seldom remarkable as faithful essays_ on the spires of some old_fashioned churches you will see sheet_iron whales placed there for weather_cocks_ but they are so elevated_ and besides that are to all intents and purposes so labelled with _hands off__ you cannot examine them closely enough to decide upon their merit_ in bony_ ribby regions of the earth_ where at the base of high broken cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain_ you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the leviathan partly merged in grass_ which of a windy day breaks against them in a surf of green surges_ then_ again_ in mountainous countries where the traveller is continually girdled by amphitheatrical heights_ here and there from some lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpses of the profiles of whales defined along the undulating ridges_ but you must be a thorough whaleman_ to see these sights_ and not only that_ but if you wish to return to such a sight again_ you must be sure and take the exact intersecting latitude and longitude of your first stand_point_ else so chance_like are such observations of the hills_ that your precise_ previous stand_point would require a laborious re_discovery_ like the soloma islands_ which still remain incognita_ though once high_ruffed mendanna trod them and old figuera chronicled them_ nor when expandingly lifted by your subject_ can you fail to trace out great whales in the starry heavens_ and boats in pursuit of them_ as when long filled with thoughts of war the eastern nations saw armies locked in battle among the clouds_ thus at the north have i chased leviathan round and round the pole with the revolutions of the bright points that first defined him to me_ and beneath the effulgent antarctic skies i have boarded the argo_navis_ and joined the chase against the starry cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of hydrus and the flying fish_ with a frigate_s anchors for my bridle_bitts and fasces of harpoons for spurs_ would i could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies_ to see whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents really lie encamped beyond my mortal sight_ chapter ___ brit_ steering north_eastward from the crozetts_ we fell in with vast meadows of brit_ the minute_ yellow substance_ upon which the right whale largely feeds_ for leagues and leagues it undulated round us_ so that we seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and golden wheat_ on the second day_ numbers of right whales were seen_ who_ secure from the attack of a sperm whaler like the pequod_ with open jaws sluggishly swam through the brit_ which_ adhering to the fringing fibres of that wondrous venetian blind in their mouths_ was in that manner separated from the water that escaped at the lip_ as morning mowers_ who side by side slowly and seethingly advance their scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads_ even so these monsters swam_ making a strange_ grassy_ cutting sound_ and leaving behind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea__ _that part of the sea known among whalemen as the _brazil banks_ does not bear that name as the banks of newfoundland do_ because of there being shallows and soundings there_ but because of this remarkable meadow_like appearance_ caused by the vast drifts of brit continually floating in those latitudes_ where the right whale is often chased_ but it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at all reminded one of mowers_ seen from the mast_heads_ especially when they paused and were stationary for a while_ their vast black forms looked more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else_ and as in the great hunting countries of india_ the stranger at a distance will sometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them to be such_ taking them for bare_ blackened elevations of the soil_ even so_ often_ with him_ who for the first time beholds this species of the leviathans of the sea_ and even when recognised at last_ their immense magnitude renders it very hard really to believe that such bulky masses of overgrowth can possibly be instinct_ in all parts_ with the same sort of life that lives in a dog or a horse_ indeed_ in other respects_ you can hardly regard any creatures of the deep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore_ for though some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are of their kind in the sea_ and though taking a broad general view of the thing_ this may very well be_ yet coming to specialties_ where_ for example_ does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to the sagacious kindness of the dog_ the accursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him_ but though_ to landsmen in general_ the native inhabitants of the seas have ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and repelling_ though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita_ so that columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover his one superficial western one_ though_ by vast odds_ the most terrific of all mortal disasters have immemorially and indiscriminately befallen tens and hundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon the waters_ though but a moment_s consideration will teach_ that however baby man may brag of his science and skill_ and however much_ in a flattering future_ that science and skill may augment_ yet for ever and for ever_ to the crack of doom_ the sea will insult and murder him_ and pulverize the stateliest_ stiffest frigate he can make_ nevertheless_ by the continual repetition of these very impressions_ man has lost that sense of the full awfulness of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it_ the first boat we read of_ floated on an ocean_ that with portuguese vengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow_ that same ocean rolls now_ that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships of last year_ yea_ foolish mortals_ noah_s flood is not yet subsided_ two thirds of the fair world it yet covers_ wherein differ the sea and the land_ that a miracle upon one is not a miracle upon the other_ preternatural terrors rested upon the hebrews_ when under the feet of korah and his company the live ground opened and swallowed them up for ever_ yet not a modern sun ever sets_ but in precisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crews_ but not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it_ but it is also a fiend to its own off_spring_ worse than the persian host who murdered his own guests_ sparing not the creatures which itself hath spawned_ like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her own cubs_ so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the rocks_ and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of ships_ no mercy_ no power but its own controls it_ panting and snorting like a mad battle steed that has lost its rider_ the masterless ocean overruns the globe_ consider the subtleness of the sea_ how its most dreaded creatures glide under water_ unapparent for the most part_ and treacherously hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure_ consider also the devilish brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes_ as the dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks_ consider_ once more_ the universal cannibalism of the sea_ all whose creatures prey upon each other_ carrying on eternal war since the world began_ consider all this_ and then turn to this green_ gentle_ and most docile earth_ consider them both_ the sea and the land_ and do you not find a strange analogy to something in yourself_ for as this appalling ocean surrounds the verdant land_ so in the soul of man there lies one insular tahiti_ full of peace and joy_ but encompassed by all the horrors of the half known life_ god keep thee_ push not off from that isle_ thou canst never return_ chapter ___ squid_ slowly wading through the meadows of brit_ the pequod still held on her way north_eastward towards the island of java_ a gentle air impelling her keel_ so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering masts mildly waved to that languid breeze_ as three mild palms on a plain_ and still_ at wide intervals in the silvery night_ the lonely_ alluring jet would be seen_ but one transparent blue morning_ when a stillness almost preternatural spread over the sea_ however unattended with any stagnant calm_ when the long burnished sun_glade on the waters seemed a golden finger laid across them_ enjoining some secrecy_ when the slippered waves whispered together as they softly ran on_ in this profound hush of the visible sphere a strange spectre was seen by daggoo from the main_mast_head_ in the distance_ a great white mass lazily rose_ and rising higher and higher_ and disentangling itself from the azure_ at last gleamed before our prow like a snow_slide_ new slid from the hills_ thus glistening for a moment_ as slowly it subsided_ and sank_ then once more arose_ and silently gleamed_ it seemed not a whale_ and yet is this moby dick_ thought daggoo_ again the phantom went down_ but on re_appearing once more_ with a stiletto_like cry that startled every man from his nod_ the negro yelled out__there_ there again_ there she breaches_ right ahead_ the white whale_ the white whale__ upon this_ the seamen rushed to the yard_arms_ as in swarming_time the bees rush to the boughs_ bare_headed in the sultry sun_ ahab stood on the bowsprit_ and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave his orders to the helmsman_ cast his eager glance in the direction indicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of daggoo_ whether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had gradually worked upon ahab_ so that he was now prepared to connect the ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular whale he pursued_ however this was_ or whether his eagerness betrayed him_ whichever way it might have been_ no sooner did he distinctly perceive the white mass_ than with a quick intensity he instantly gave orders for lowering_ the four boats were soon on the water_ ahab_s in advance_ and all swiftly pulling towards their prey_ soon it went down_ and while_ with oars suspended_ we were awaiting its reappearance_ lo_ in the same spot where it sank_ once more it slowly rose_ almost forgetting for the moment all thoughts of moby dick_ we now gazed at the most wondrous phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind_ a vast pulpy mass_ furlongs in length and breadth_ of a glancing cream_colour_ lay floating on the water_ innumerable long arms radiating from its centre_ and curling and twisting like a nest of anacondas_ as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach_ no perceptible face or front did it have_ no conceivable token of either sensation or instinct_ but undulated there on the billows_ an unearthly_ formless_ chance_like apparition of life_ as with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again_ starbuck still gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk_ with a wild voice exclaimed__almost rather had i seen moby dick and fought him_ than to have seen thee_ thou white ghost__ _what was it_ sir__ said flask_ _the great live squid_ which_ they say_ few whale_ships ever beheld_ and returned to their ports to tell of it__ but ahab said nothing_ turning his boat_ he sailed back to the vessel_ the rest as silently following_ whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected with the sight of this object_ certain it is_ that a glimpse of it being so very unusual_ that circumstance has gone far to invest it with portentousness_ so rarely is it beheld_ that though one and all of them declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean_ yet very few of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature and form_ notwithstanding_ they believe it to furnish to the sperm whale his only food_ for though other species of whales find their food above water_ and may be seen by man in the act of feeding_ the spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones below the surface_ and only by inference is it that any one can tell of what_ precisely_ that food consists_ at times_ when closely pursued_ he will disgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid_ some of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length_ they fancy that the monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean_ and that the sperm whale_ unlike other species_ is supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it_ there seems some ground to imagine that the great kraken of bishop pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into squid_ the manner in which the bishop describes it_ as alternately rising and sinking_ with some other particulars he narrates_ in all this the two correspond_ but much abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he assigns it_ by some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious creature_ here spoken of_ it is included among the class of cuttle_fish_ to which_ indeed_ in certain external respects it would seem to belong_ but only as the anak of the tribe_ chapter ___ the line_ with reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described_ as well as for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented_ i have here to speak of the magical_ sometimes horrible whale_line_ the line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp_ slightly vapoured with tar_ not impregnated with it_ as in the case of ordinary ropes_ for while tar_ as ordinarily used_ makes the hemp more pliable to the rope_maker_ and also renders the rope itself more convenient to the sailor for common ship use_ yet_ not only would the ordinary quantity too much stiffen the whale_line for the close coiling to which it must be subjected_ but as most seamen are beginning to learn_ tar in general by no means adds to the rope_s durability or strength_ however much it may give it compactness and gloss_ of late years the manilla rope has in the american fishery almost entirely superseded hemp as a material for whale_lines_ for_ though not so durable as hemp_ it is stronger_ and far more soft and elastic_ and i will add _since there is an aesthetics in all things__ is much more handsome and becoming to the boat_ than hemp_ hemp is a dusky_ dark fellow_ a sort of indian_ but manilla is as a golden_haired circassian to behold_ the whale_line is only two_thirds of an inch in thickness_ at first sight_ you would not think it so strong as it really is_ by experiment its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty pounds_ so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three tons_ in length_ the common sperm whale_line measures something over two hundred fathoms_ towards the stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub_ not like the worm_pipe of a still though_ but so as to form one round_ cheese_shaped mass of densely bedded _sheaves__ or layers of concentric spiralizations_ without any hollow but the _heart__ or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese_ as the least tangle or kink in the coiling would_ in running out_ infallibly take somebody_s arm_ leg_ or entire body off_ the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub_ some harpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this business_ carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a block towards the tub_ so as in the act of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and twists_ in the english boats two tubs are used instead of one_ the same line being continuously coiled in both tubs_ there is some advantage in this_ because these twin_tubs being so small they fit more readily into the boat_ and do not strain it so much_ whereas_ the american tub_ nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth_ makes a rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one half_inch in thickness_ for the bottom of the whale_boat is like critical ice_ which will bear up a considerable distributed weight_ but not very much of a concentrated one_ when the painted canvas cover is clapped on the american line_tub_ the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a prodigious great wedding_cake to present to the whales_ both ends of the line are exposed_ the lower end terminating in an eye_splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub_ and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything_ this arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts_ first_ in order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring boat_ in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the harpoon_ in these instances_ the whale of course is shifted like a mug of ale_ as it were_ from the one boat to the other_ though the

explosion_ so the graceful repose of the line_ as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought into actual play_this is a thing which carries more of true terror than any other

after the power which first moved it is withdrawn_ ere forgetfulness altogether came over me_ i had noticed that the seamen at the main and mizzen_mast_heads were already drowsy_ so that at last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars_ and for every swing that we made there was a nod from below from the slumbering helmsman_ the waves_ too_ nodded their indolent crests_ and across the wide trance of the sea_ east nodded to west_ and the sun over all_ suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes_ like vices my hands grasped the shrouds_ some invisible_ gracious agency

glossy back_ of an ethiopian hue_ glistening in the sun_s rays like a mirror_ but lazily undulating in the trough of the sea_ and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapoury jet_ the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm afternoon_ but that pipe_ poor whale_ was thy last_ as if struck by some enchanter_s wand_ the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once started into wakefulness_ and more than a score of voices from all parts of the vessel_ simultaneously with the three notes from aloft_ shouted forth the accustomed cry_ as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air_ _clear away the boats_ luff__ cried ahab_ and obeying his own order_ he dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes_ the sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale_ and ere the boats were down_ majestically turning_ he swam away to the leeward_ but with such a steady tranquillity_ and making so few ripples as he swam_ that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed_ ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used_ and no man must speak but in whispers_ so seated like ontario indians on the gunwales of the boats_ we swiftly but silently paddled along_ the calm not admitting of the noiseless sails being set_ presently_ as we thus glided in chase_ the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air_ and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up_ _there go flukes__ was the cry_ an announcement immediately followed by stubb_s producing his match and igniting his pipe_ for

_head out__ that part obliquely projecting from the mad yeast which he brewed__ _it will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the entire interior of the sperm whale_s enormous head consists_ though apparently the most massive_ it is by far the most buoyant part about him_ so that with ease he elevates it in the air_ and invariably does so when going at his utmost speed_ besides_ such is the breadth of the upper part of the front of his head_ and such the tapering cut_water formation of the lower part_ that by obliquely elevating his head_ he thereby may be said to transform himself from a bluff_bowed sluggish galliot into a sharppointed new york pilot_boat_ _start her_ start her_ my men_ don_t hurry yourselves_ take plenty of time_but start her_ start her like

encouraged his men to the onset_ all the while puffing the smoke from his mouth_ like desperadoes they tugged and they strained_ till the welcome cry was heard__stand up_ tashtego__give it to him__ the harpoon was hurled_ _stern all__ the oarsmen backed water_ the same moment something went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists_ it was the magical line_ an instant before_ stubb had swiftly caught two additional turns with it round the loggerhead_ whence_ by reason of its increased rapid circlings_ a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with the steady fumes from his pipe_ as the line passed round and round the loggerhead_ so also_ just before reaching that point_ it blisteringly passed through and through both of stubb_s hands_ from which the hand_cloths_ or squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at these times_ had accidentally dropped_ it was like holding an enemy_s sharp two_edged sword by the blade_ and that enemy all the time striving to wrest it out of your clutch_ _wet the line_ wet the line__ cried stubb to the tub oarsman _him seated by the tub_ who_ snatching off his hat_ dashed sea_water into it__ more turns were taken_ so that the line began holding its place_ the boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins_ stubb and tashtego here changed places_stem for stern_a staggering business truly in that rocking commotion_ _partly to show the indispensableness of this act_ it may here be stated_ that_ in the old dutch fishery_ a mop was used to dash the running line with water_ in many other ships_ a wooden piggin_ or bailer_ is set apart for that purpose_ your hat_ however_ is the most convenient_ from the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part of the boat_ and from its now being more tight than a harpstring_ you would have thought the craft had two keels_one cleaving the water_ the other the air_as the boat churned on through both opposing elements at once_ a continual cascade played at the bows_ a ceaseless whirling eddy in her wake_ and_ at the slightest motion from within_ even but of a little finger_ the vibrating_ cracking craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale into the sea_ thus they rushed_ each man with might and main clinging to his seat_ to prevent being tossed to the foam_ and the tall form of tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double_ in order to bring down his centre of gravity_ whole atlantics and pacifics seemed passed as they shot on their way_ till at length the whale somewhat slackened his flight_ _haul in_haul in__ cried stubb to the bowsman_ and_ facing round towards the whale_ all hands began pulling the boat up to him_ while yet the boat was being towed on_ soon ranging up by his flank_ stubb_ firmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat_ darted dart after dart into the flying fish_ at the word of command_ the boat alternately sterning out of the way of the whale_s horrible wallow_ and then ranging up for another fling_ the red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down a hill_ his tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood_ which bubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake_ the slanting sun playing upon this crimson pond in the sea_ sent back its reflection into every face_ so that they all glowed to each other like red men_ and all the while_ jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale_ and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of the excited headsman_ as at every dart_ hauling in upon his crooked lance _by the line attached to it__ stubb straightened it again and again_ by a few rapid blows against the gunwale_ then again and again sent it into the whale_ _pull up_pull up__ he now cried to the bowsman_ as the waning whale relaxed in his wrath_ _pull up__close to__ and the boat ranged along the fish_s flank_ when reaching far over the bow_ stubb slowly churned his long sharp lance into the fish_ and kept it there_ carefully churning and churning_ as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold watch that the whale might have swallowed_ and which he was fearful of breaking ere he could hook it out_ but that gold watch he sought was the innermost life of the fish_ and now it is struck_ for_ starting from his trance into that unspeakable thing called his _flurry__ the monster horribly wallowed in his blood_ overwrapped himself in impenetrable_ mad_ boiling spray_ so that the imperilled craft_ instantly dropping astern_ had much ado blindly to struggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the day_ and now abating in his flurry_ the whale once more rolled out into view_ surging from side to side_ spasmodically dilating and contracting his spout_hole_ with sharp_ cracking_ agonized respirations_ at last_ gush after gush of clotted red gore_ as if it had been the purple lees of red wine_ shot into the frighted air_ and falling back again_ ran dripping down his motionless flanks into the sea_ his heart had burst_ _he_s dead_ mr_ stubb__ said daggoo_ _yes_ both pipes smoked out__ and withdrawing his own from his mouth_ stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water_ and_ for a moment_ stood thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made_ chapter ___ the dart_ a word concerning an incident in the last chapter_ according to the invariable usage of the fishery_ the whale_boat pushes off from the ship_ with the headsman or whale_killer as temporary steersman_ and the harpooneer or whale_fastener pulling the foremost oar_ the one known as the harpooneer_oar_ now it needs a strong_ nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish_ for often_ in what is called a long dart_ the heavy implement has to be flung to the distance of twenty or thirty feet_ but however prolonged and exhausting the chase_ the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost_ indeed_ he is expected to set an example of superhuman activity to the rest_ not only by incredible rowing_ but by repeated loud and intrepid exclamations_ and what it is to keep shouting at the top of one_s compass_ while all the other muscles are strained and half started_what that is none know but those who have tried it_ for one_ i cannot bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same time_ in this straining_ bawling state_ then_ with his back to the fish_ all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting cry__stand up_ and give it to him__ he now has to drop and secure his oar_ turn round on his centre half way_ seize his harpoon from the crotch_ and with what little strength may remain_ he essays to pitch it somehow into the whale_ no wonder_ taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body_ that out of fifty fair chances for a dart_ not five are successful_ no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated_ no wonder that some of them actually burst their blood_vessels in the boat_ no wonder that some sperm whalemen are absent four years with four barrels_ no wonder that to many ship owners_ whaling is but a losing concern_ for it is the harpooneer that makes the voyage_ and if you take the breath out of his body how can you expect to find it there when most wanted_ again_ if the dart be successful_ then at the second critical instant_ that is_ when the whale starts to run_ the boatheader and harpooneer likewise start to running fore and aft_ to the imminent jeopardy of themselves and every one else_ it is then they change places_ and the headsman_ the chief officer of the little craft_ takes his proper station in the bows of the boat_ now_ i care not who maintains the contrary_ but all this is both foolish and unnecessary_ the headsman should stay in the bows from first to last_ he should both dart the harpoon and the lance_ and no rowing whatever should be expected of him_ except under circumstances obvious to any fisherman_ i know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss of speed in the chase_ but long experience in various whalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vast majority of failures in the fishery_ it has not by any means been so much the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the harpooneer that has caused them_ to insure the greatest efficiency in the dart_ the harpooneers of this world must start to their feet from out of idleness_ and not from out of toil_ chapter ___ the crotch_ out of the trunk_ the branches grow_ out of them_ the twigs_ so_ in productive subjects_ grow the chapters_ the crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention_ it is a notched stick of a peculiar form_ some two feet in length_ which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the bow_ for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of the harpoon_ whose other naked_ barbed end slopingly projects from the prow_ thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler_ who snatches it up as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall_ it is customary to have two harpoons reposing in the crotch_ respectively called the first and second irons_ but these two harpoons_ each by its own cord_ are both connected with the line_ the object being this_ to dart them both_ if possible_ one instantly after the other into the same whale_ so that if_ in the coming drag_ one should draw out_ the other may still retain a hold_ it is a doubling of the chances_ but it very often happens that owing to the instantaneous_ violent_ convulsive running of the whale upon receiving the first iron_ it becomes impossible for the harpooneer_ however lightning_like in his movements_ to pitch the second iron into him_ nevertheless_ as the second iron is already connected with the line_ and the line is running_ hence that weapon must_ at all events_ be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat_ somehow and somewhere_ else the most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands_ tumbled into the water_ it accordingly is in such cases_ the spare coils of box line _mentioned in a preceding chapter_ making this feat_ in most instances_ prudently practicable_ but this critical act is not always unattended with the saddest and most fatal casualties_ furthermore_ you must know that when the second iron is thrown overboard_ it thenceforth becomes a dangling_ sharp_edged terror_ skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale_ entangling the lines_ or cutting them_ and making a prodigious sensation in all directions_ nor_ in general_ is it possible to secure it again until the whale is fairly captured and a corpse_ consider_ now_ how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging one unusually strong_ active_ and knowing whale_ when owing to these qualities in him_ as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of such an audacious enterprise_ eight or ten loose second irons may be simultaneously dangling about him_ for_ of course_ each boat is supplied with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the first one be ineffectually darted without recovery_ all these particulars are faithfully narrated here_ as they will not fail to elucidate several most important_ however intricate passages_ in scenes hereafter to be painted_ chapter ___ stubb_s supper_ stubb_s whale had been killed some distance from the ship_ it was a calm_ so_ forming a tandem of three boats_ we commenced the slow business of towing the trophy to the pequod_ and now_ as we eighteen men with our thirty_six arms_ and one hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers_ slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert_ sluggish corpse in the sea_ and it seemed hardly to budge at all_ except at long intervals_ good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we moved_ for_ upon the great canal of hang_ho_ or whatever they call it_ in china_ four or five laborers on the foot_path will draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour_ but this grand argosy we towed heavily forged along_ as if laden with pig_lead in bulk_ darkness came on_ but three lights up and down in the pequod_s main_rigging dimly guided our way_ till drawing nearer we saw ahab dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks_ vacantly eyeing the heaving whale for a moment_ he issued the usual orders for securing it for the night_ and then handing his lantern to a seaman_ went his way into the cabin_ and did not come forward again until morning_ though_ in overseeing the pursuit of this whale_ captain ahab had evinced his customary activity_ to call it so_ yet now that the creature was dead_ some vague dissatisfaction_ or impatience_ or despair_ seemed working in him_ as if the sight of that dead body reminded him that moby dick was yet to be slain_ and though a thousand other whales were brought to his ship_ all that would not one jot advance his grand_ monomaniac object_ very soon you would have thought from the sound on the pequod_s decks_ that all hands were preparing to cast anchor in the deep_ for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck_ and thrust rattling out of the port_holes_ but by those clanking links_ the vast corpse itself_ not the ship_ is to be moored_ tied by the head to the stern_ and by the tail to the bows_ the whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel_s and seen through the darkness of the night_ which obscured the spars and rigging aloft_ the two_ship and whale_ seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks_ whereof one reclines while the other remains standing__ _a little item may as well be related here_ the strongest and most reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside_ is by the flukes or tail_ and as from its greater density that part is relatively heavier than any other _excepting the side_fins__ its flexibility even in death_ causes it to sink low beneath the surface_ so that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat_ in order to put the chain round it_ but this difficulty is ingeniously overcome_ a small_ strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end_ and a weight in its middle_ while the other end is secured to the ship_ by adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side of the mass_ so that now having girdled the whale_ the chain is readily made to follow suit_ and being slipped along the body_ is at last locked fast round the smallest part of the tail_ at the point of junction with its broad flukes or lobes_ if moody ahab was now all quiescence_ at least so far as could be known on deck_ stubb_ his second mate_ flushed with conquest_ betrayed an unusual but still good_natured excitement_ such an unwonted bustle was he in that the staid starbuck_ his official superior_ quietly resigned to him for the time the sole management of affairs_ one small_ helping cause of all this liveliness in stubb_ was soon made strangely manifest_ stubb was a high liver_ he was somewhat intemperately fond of the whale as a flavorish thing to his palate_ _a steak_ a steak_ ere i sleep_ you_ daggoo_ overboard you go_ and cut me one from his small__ here be it known_ that though these wild fishermen do not_ as a general thing_ and according to the great military maxim_ make the enemy defray the current expenses of the war _at least before realizing the proceeds of the voyage__ yet now and then you find some of these nantucketers who have a genuine relish for that particular part of the sperm whale designated by stubb_ comprising the tapering extremity of the body_ about midnight that steak was cut and cooked_ and lighted by two lanterns of sperm oil_ stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper at the capstan_head_ as if that capstan were a sideboard_ nor was stubb the only banqueter on whale_s flesh that night_ mingling their mumblings with his own mastications_ thousands on thousands of sharks_ swarming round the dead leviathan_ smackingly feasted on its fatness_ the few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharp slapping of their tails against the hull_ within a few inches of the sleepers_ hearts_ peering over the side you could just see them _as before you heard them_ wallowing in the sullen_ black waters_ and turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head_ this particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous_ how at such an apparently unassailable surface_ they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls_ remains a part of the universal problem of all things_ the mark they thus leave on the whale_ may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw_ though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea_fight_ sharks will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship_s decks_ like hungry dogs round a table where red meat is being carved_ ready to bolt down every killed man that is tossed to them_ and though_ while the valiant butchers over the deck_table are thus cannibally carving each other_s live meat with carving_knives all gilded and tasselled_ the sharks_ also_ with their jewel_hilted mouths_ are quarrelsomely carving away under the table at the dead meat_ and though_ were you to turn the whole affair upside down_ it would still be pretty much the same thing_ that is to say_ a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties_ and though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships crossing the atlantic_ systematically trotting alongside_ to be handy in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere_ or a dead slave to be decently buried_ and though one or two other like instances might be set down_ touching the set terms_ places_ and occasions_ when sharks do most socially congregate_ and most hilariously feast_ yet is there no conceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless numbers_ and in gayer or more jovial spirits_ than around a dead sperm whale_ moored by night to a whaleship at sea_ if you have never seen that sight_ then suspend your decision about the propriety of devil_worship_ and the expediency of conciliating the devil_ but_ as yet_ stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was going on so nigh him_ no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of his own epicurean lips_ _cook_ cook__where_s that old

feeds his lamp_ and_ like stubb_ eat him by his own light_ as you may say_ this seems so outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and philosophy of it_ it is upon record_ that three centuries ago the tongue of the right whale was esteemed a great delicacy in france_ and commanded large prices there_ also_ that in henry viiith_s time_ a certain cook of the court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with barbacued porpoises_ which_ you remember_ are a species of whale_ porpoises_ indeed_ are to this day considered fine eating_ the meat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls_ and being well seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle_balls or veal balls_ the old monks of dunfermline were very fond of them_ they had a great porpoise grant from the crown_ the fact is_ that among his hunters at least_ the whale would by all hands be considered a noble dish_ were there not so much of him_ but when you come to sit down before a meat_pie nearly one hundred feet long_ it takes away your appetite_ only the most unprejudiced of men like stubb_ nowadays partake of cooked whales_ but the esquimaux are not so fastidious_ we all know how they live upon whales_ and have rare old vintages of prime old train oil_ zogranda_ one of their most famous doctors_ recommends strips of blubber for infants_ as being exceedingly juicy and nourishing_ and this reminds me that certain englishmen_ who long ago were accidentally left in greenland by a whaling vessel_that these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber_ among the dutch whalemen these scraps are called _fritters__ which_ indeed_ they greatly resemble_ being brown and crisp_ and smelling something like old amsterdam housewives_ dough_nuts or oly_cooks_ when fresh_ they have such an eatable look that the most self_denying stranger can hardly keep his hands off_ but what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish_ is his exceeding richness_ he is the great prize ox of the sea_ too fat to be delicately good_ look at his hump_ which would be as fine eating as the buffalo_s _which is esteemed a rare dish__ were it not such a solid pyramid of fat_ but the spermaceti itself_ how bland and creamy that is_ like the transparent_ half_jellied_ white meat of a cocoanut in the third month of its growth_ yet far too rich to supply a substitute for butter_ nevertheless_ many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into some other substance_ and then partaking of it_ in the long try watches of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their ship_biscuit into the huge oil_pots and let them fry there awhile_ many a good supper have i thus made_ in the case of a small sperm whale the brains are accounted a fine dish_ the casket of the skull is broken into with an axe_ and the two plump_ whitish lobes being withdrawn _precisely resembling two large puddings__ they are then mixed with flour_ and cooked into a most delectable mess_ in flavor somewhat resembling calves_ head_ which is quite a dish among some epicures_ and every one knows that some young bucks among the epicures_ by continually dining upon calves_ brains_ by and by get to have a little brains of their own_ so as to be able to tell a calf_s head from their own heads_ which_ indeed_ requires uncommon discrimination_ and that is the reason why a young buck with an intelligent looking calf_s head before him_ is somehow one of the saddest sights you can see_ the head looks a sort of reproachfully at him_ with an _et tu brute__ expression_ it is not_ perhaps_ entirely because the whale is so excessively unctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with abhorrence_ that appears to result_ in some way_ from the consideration before mentioned_ i_e_ that a man should eat a newly murdered thing of the sea_ and eat it too by its own light_ but no doubt the first man that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer_ perhaps he was hung_ and if he had been put on his trial by oxen_ he certainly would have been_ and he certainly deserved it if any

patronise nothing but steel pens_ chapter ___ the shark massacre_ when in the southern fishery_ a captured sperm whale_ after long and weary toil_ is brought alongside late at night_ it is not_ as a general thing at least_ customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting him in_ for that business is an exceedingly laborious one_ is not very soon completed_ and requires all hands to set about it_ therefore_ the common usage is to take in all sail_ lash the helm a_lee_ and then send every one below to his hammock till daylight_ with the reservation that_ until that time_ anchor_watches shall be kept_ that is_ two and two for an hour_ each couple_ the crew in rotation shall mount the deck to see that all goes well_ but sometimes_ especially upon the line in the pacific_ this plan will not answer at all_ because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather round the moored carcase_ that were he left so for six hours_ say_ on a stretch_ little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning_ in most other parts of the ocean_ however_ where these fish do not so largely abound_ their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably diminished_ by vigorously stirring them up with sharp whaling_spades_ a procedure notwithstanding_ which_ in some instances_ only seems to tickle them into still greater activity_ but it was not thus in the present case with the pequod_s sharks_ though_ to be sure_ any man unaccustomed to such sights_ to have looked over her side that night_ would have almost thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese_ and those sharks the maggots in it_ nevertheless_ upon stubb setting the anchor_watch after his supper was concluded_ and when_ accordingly_ queequeg and a forecastle seaman came on deck_ no small excitement was created among the sharks_ for immediately suspending the cutting stages over the side_ and lowering three lanterns_ so that they cast long gleams of light over the turbid sea_ these two mariners_ darting their long whaling_spades_ kept up an incessant murdering of the sharks__ by striking the keen steel deep into their skulls_ seemingly their only vital part_ but in the foamy confusion of their mixed and struggling hosts_ the marksmen could not always hit their mark_ and this brought about new revelations of the incredible ferocity of the foe_ they viciously snapped_ not only at each other_s disembowelments_ but like flexible bows_ bent round_ and bit their own_ till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again by the same mouth_ to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound_ nor was this all_ it was unsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these creatures_ a sort of generic or pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in their very joints and bones_ after

dead lid of his murderous jaw_ _the whaling_spade used for cutting_in is made of the very best steel_ is about the bigness of a man_s spread hand_ and in general shape_ corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named_ only its sides are perfectly flat_ and its upper end considerably narrower than the lower_ this weapon is always kept as sharp as possible_ and when being used is

lift_this vast bunch of grapes was swayed up to the main_top and firmly lashed to the lower mast_head_ the strongest point anywhere above a ship_s deck_ the end of the hawser_like rope winding through these intricacies_ was then conducted to the windlass_ and the huge lower block of the tackles was swung over the whale_ to this block the great blubber hook_ weighing some one hundred pounds_ was attached_ and now suspended in stages over the side_ starbuck and stubb_ the mates_ armed with their long spades_ began cutting a hole in the body for the insertion of the hook just above the nearest of the two side_fins_ this done_ a broad_ semicircular line is cut round the hole_ the hook is inserted_ and the main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus_ now commence heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass_ when instantly_ the entire ship careens over on her side_ every bolt in her starts like the nail_heads of an old house in frosty weather_ she trembles_ quivers_ and nods her frighted mast_heads to the sky_ more and more she leans over to the whale_ while every gasping heave of the windlass is answered by a helping heave from the billows_ till at last_ a swift_ startling snap is heard_ with a great swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from the whale_ and the triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after it the disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber_ now as the blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange_ so is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing it_ for the strain constantly kept up by the windlass continually keeps the whale rolling over and over in the water_ and as the blubber in one strip uniformly peels off along the line called the _scarf__ simultaneously cut by the spades of starbuck and stubb_ the mates_ and just as fast as it is thus peeled off_ and indeed by that very act itself_ it is all the time being hoisted higher and higher aloft till its upper end grazes the main_top_ the men at the windlass then cease heaving_ and for a moment or two the prodigious blood_dripping mass sways to and fro as if let down from the sky_ and every one present must take good heed to dodge it when it swings_ else it may box his ears and pitch him headlong overboard_ one of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long_ keen weapon called a boarding_sword_ and watching his chance he dexterously slices out a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass_ into this hole_ the end of the second alternating great tackle is then hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber_ in order to prepare for what follows_ whereupon_ this accomplished swordsman_ warning all hands to stand off_ once more makes a scientific dash at the mass_ and with a few sidelong_ desperate_ lunging slicings_ severs it completely in twain_ so that while the short lower part is still fast_ the long upper strip_ called a blanket_piece_ swings clear_ and is all ready for lowering_ the heavers forward now resume their song_ and while the one tackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale_ the other is slowly slackened away_ and down goes the first strip through the main hatchway right beneath_ into an unfurnished parlor called the blubber_room_ into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep coiling away the long blanket_piece as if it were a great live mass of plaited serpents_ and thus the work proceeds_ the two tackles hoisting and lowering simultaneously_ both whale and windlass heaving_ the heavers singing_ the blubber_room gentlemen coiling_ the mates scarfing_ the ship straining_ and all hands swearing occasionally_ by way of assuaging the general friction_ chapter ___ the blanket_ i have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject_ the skin of the whale_ i have had controversies about it with experienced whalemen afloat_ and learned naturalists ashore_ my original opinion remains unchanged_ but it is only an opinion_ the question is_ what and where is the skin of the whale_ already you know what his blubber is_ that blubber is something of the consistence of firm_ close_grained beef_ but tougher_ more elastic and compact_ and ranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness_ now_ however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any creature_s skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness_ yet in point of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption_ because you cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from the whale_s body but that same blubber_ and the outermost enveloping layer of any animal_ if reasonably dense_ what can that be but the skin_ true_ from the unmarred dead body of the whale_ you may scrape off with your hand an infinitely thin_ transparent substance_ somewhat resembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass_ only it is almost as flexible and soft as satin_ that is_ previous to being dried_ when it not only contracts and thickens_ but becomes rather hard and brittle_ i have several such dried bits_ which i use for marks in my whale_books_ it is transparent_ as i said before_ and being laid upon the printed page_ i have sometimes pleased myself with fancying it exerted a magnifying influence_ at any rate_ it is pleasant to read about whales through their own spectacles_ as you may say_ but what i am driving at here is this_ that same infinitely thin_ isinglass substance_ which_ i admit_ invests the entire body of the whale_ is not so much to be regarded as the skin of the creature_ as the skin of the skin_ so to speak_ for it were simply ridiculous to say_ that the proper skin of the tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a new_born child_ but no more of this_ assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale_ then_ when this skin_ as in the case of a very large sperm whale_ will yield the bulk of one hundred barrels of oil_ and_ when it is considered that_ in quantity_ or rather weight_ that oil_ in its expressed state_ is only three fourths_ and not the entire substance of the coat_ some idea may hence be had of the enormousness of that animated mass_ a mere part of whose mere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that_ reckoning ten barrels to the ton_ you have ten tons for the net weight of only three quarters of the stuff of the whale_s skin_ in life_ the visible surface of the sperm whale is not the least among the many marvels he presents_ almost invariably it is all over obliquely crossed and re_crossed with numberless straight marks in thick array_ something like those in the finest italian line engravings_ but these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the isinglass substance above mentioned_ but seem to be seen through it_ as if they were engraved upon the body itself_ nor is this all_ in some instances_ to the quick_ observant eye_ those linear marks_ as in a veritable engraving_ but afford the ground for far other delineations_ these are hieroglyphical_ that is_ if you call those mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics_ then that is the proper word to use in the present connexion_ by my retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one sperm whale in particular_ i was much struck with a plate representing the old indian characters chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the upper mississippi_ like those mystic rocks_ too_ the mystic_marked whale remains undecipherable_ this allusion to the indian rocks reminds me of another thing_ besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the sperm whale presents_ he not seldom displays the back_ and more especially his flanks_ effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance_ by reason of numerous rude scratches_ altogether of an irregular_ random aspect_ i should say that those new england rocks on the sea_coast_ which agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping contact with vast floating icebergs_i should say_ that those rocks must not a little resemble the sperm whale in this particular_ it also seems to me that such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile contact with other whales_ for i have most remarked them in the large_ full_grown bulls of the species_ a word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the whale_ it has already been said_ that it is stript from him in long pieces_ called blanket_pieces_ like most sea_terms_ this one is very happy and significant_ for the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a real blanket or counterpane_ or_ still better_ an indian poncho slipt over his head_ and skirting his extremity_ it is by reason of this cosy blanketing of his body_ that the whale is enabled to keep himself comfortable in all weathers_ in all seas_ times_ and tides_ what would become of a greenland whale_ say_ in those shuddering_ icy seas of the north_ if unsupplied with his cosy surtout_ true_ other fish are found exceedingly brisk in those hyperborean waters_ but these_ be it observed_ are your cold_blooded_ lungless fish_ whose very bellies are refrigerators_ creatures_ that warm themselves under the lee of an iceberg_ as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn fire_ whereas_ like man_ the whale has lungs and warm blood_ freeze his blood_ and he dies_ how wonderful is it then_except after explanation_that this great monster_ to whom corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it is to man_ how wonderful that he should be found at home_ immersed to his lips for life in those arctic waters_ where_ when seamen fall overboard_ they are sometimes found_ months afterwards_ perpendicularly frozen into the hearts of fields of ice_ as a fly is found glued in amber_ but more surprising is it to know_ as has been proved by experiment_ that the blood of a polar whale is warmer than that of a borneo negro in summer_ it does seem to me_ that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong individual vitality_ and the rare virtue of thick walls_ and the rare virtue of interior spaciousness_ oh_ man_ admire and model thyself after the whale_ do thou_ too_ remain warm among ice_ do thou_ too_ live in this world without being of it_ be cool at the equator_ keep thy blood fluid at the pole_ like the great dome of st_ peter_s_ and like the great whale_ retain_ o man_ in all seasons

stripping the body of the leviathan_ he was beheaded_ now_ the beheading of the sperm whale is a scientific anatomical feat_ upon which experienced whale surgeons very much pride themselves_ and not without reason_ consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck_ on the contrary_ where his head and body seem to join_ there_ in that very place_ is the thickest part of him_ remember_ also_ that the surgeon must operate from above_ some eight or ten feet intervening between him and his subject_ and that subject almost hidden in a discoloured_ rolling_ and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea_ bear in mind_ too_ that under these untoward circumstances he has to cut many feet deep in the flesh_ and in that subterraneous manner_ without so much as getting one

notabilities make up all totalities_ he was a small_ short_ youngish man_ sprinkled all over his face with freckles_ and wearing redundant yellow hair_ a long_skirted_ cabalistically_cut coat of a faded walnut tinge enveloped him_ the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on his wrists_ a deep_ settled_ fanatic delirium was in his eyes_ so soon as this figure had been first descried_ stubb had exclaimed__that_s he_ that_s he__the long_togged scaramouch the town_ho_s company told us of__ stubb here alluded to a strange story told of the jeroboam_ and a certain man among her crew_ some time previous when the pequod spoke the town_ho_ according to this account and what was subsequently learned_ it seemed that the scaramouch in question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the jeroboam_ his story was this_ he had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of neskyeuna shakers_ where he had been a great prophet_ in their cracked_ secret meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a trap_door_ announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial_ which he carried in his vest_pocket_ but_ which_ instead of containing gunpowder_ was supposed to be charged with laudanum_ a strange_ apostolic whim having seized him_ he had left neskyeuna for nantucket_ where_ with that cunning peculiar to craziness_ he assumed a steady_ common_sense exterior_ and offered himself as a green_hand candidate for the jeroboam_s whaling voyage_ they engaged him_ but straightway upon the ship_s getting out of sight of land_ his insanity broke out in a freshet_ he announced himself as the archangel gabriel_ and commanded the captain to jump overboard_ he published his manifesto_ whereby he set himself forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea and vicar_general of all oceanica_ the unflinching earnestness with which he declared these things__the dark_ daring play of his sleepless_ excited imagination_ and all the preternatural terrors of real delirium_ united to invest this gabriel in the minds of the majority of the ignorant crew_ with an atmosphere of sacredness_ moreover_ they were afraid of him_ as such a man_ however_ was not of much practical use in the ship_ especially as he refused to work except when he pleased_ the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him_ but apprised that that individual_s intention was to land him in the first convenient port_ the archangel forthwith opened all his seals and vials_devoting the ship and all hands to unconditional perdition_ in case this intention was carried out_ so strongly did he work upon his disciples among the crew_ that at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if gabriel was sent from the ship_ not a man of them would remain_ he was therefore forced to relinquish his plan_ nor would they permit gabriel to be any way maltreated_ say or do what he would_ so that it came to pass that gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship_ the consequence of all this was_ that the archangel cared little or nothing for the captain and mates_ and since the epidemic had broken out_ he carried a higher hand than ever_ declaring that the plague_ as he called it_ was at his sole command_ nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleasure_ the sailors_ mostly poor devils_ cringed_ and some of them fawned before him_ in obedience to his instructions_ sometimes rendering him personal homage_ as to a god_ such things may seem incredible_ but_ however wondrous_ they are true_ nor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to the measureless self_deception of the fanatic himself_ as his measureless power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others_ but it is time to return to the pequod_ _i fear not thy epidemic_ man__ said ahab from the bulwarks_ to captain mayhew_ who stood in the boat_s stern_ _come on board__ but now gabriel started to his feet_ _think_ think of the fevers_ yellow and bilious_ beware of the horrible plague__ _gabriel_ gabriel__ cried captain mayhew_ _thou must either__ but that instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead_ and its seethings drowned all speech_ _hast thou seen the white whale__ demanded ahab_ when the boat drifted back_ _think_ think of thy whale_boat_ stoven and sunk_ beware of the horrible tail__ _i tell thee again_ gabriel_ that__ but again the boat tore ahead as if dragged by fiends_ nothing was said for some moments_ while a succession of riotous waves rolled by_ which by one of those occasional caprices of the seas were tumbling_ not heaving it_ meantime_ the hoisted sperm whale_s head jogged about very violently_ and gabriel was seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel nature seemed to warrant_ when this interlude was over_ captain mayhew began a dark story concerning moby dick_ not_ however_ without frequent interruptions from gabriel_ whenever his name was mentioned_ and the crazy sea that seemed leagued with him_ it seemed that the jeroboam had not long left home_ when upon speaking a whale_ship_ her people were reliably apprised of the existence of moby dick_ and the havoc he had made_ greedily sucking in this intelligence_ gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the white whale_ in case the monster should be seen_ in his gibbering insanity_ pronouncing the white whale to be no less a being than the shaker god incarnated_ the shakers receiving the bible_ but when_ some year or two afterwards_ moby dick was fairly sighted from the mast_heads_ macey_ the chief mate_ burned with ardour to encounter him_ and the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the opportunity_ despite all the archangel_s denunciations and forewarnings_ macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat_ with them he pushed off_ and_ after much weary pulling_ and many perilous_ unsuccessful onsets_ he at last succeeded in getting one iron fast_ meantime_ gabriel_ ascending to the main_royal mast_head_ was tossing one arm in frantic gestures_ and hurling forth prophecies of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity_ now_ while macey_ the mate_ was standing up in his boat_s bow_ and with all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the whale_ and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance_ lo_ a broad white shadow rose from the sea_ by its quick_ fanning motion_ temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen_ next instant_ the luckless mate_ so full of furious life_ was smitten bodily into the air_ and making a long arc in his descent_ fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty yards_ not a chip of the boat was harmed_ nor a hair of any oarsman_s head_ but the mate for ever sank_ it is well to parenthesize here_ that of the fatal accidents in the sperm_whale fishery_ this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any_ sometimes_ nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated_ oftener the boat_s bow is knocked off_ or the thigh_board_ in which the headsman stands_ is torn from its place and accompanies the body_ but strangest of all is the circumstance_ that in more instances than one_ when the body has been recovered_ not a single mark of violence is discernible_ the man being stark dead_ the whole calamity_ with the falling form of macey_ was plainly descried from the ship_ raising a piercing shriek__the vial_ the vial__ gabriel called off the terror_stricken crew from the further hunting of the whale_ this terrible event clothed the archangel with added influence_ because his credulous disciples believed that he had specifically fore_announced it_ instead of only making a general prophecy_ which any one might have done_ and so have chanced to hit one of many marks in the wide margin allowed_ he became a nameless terror to the ship_ mayhew having concluded his narration_ ahab put such questions to him_ that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he intended to hunt the white whale_ if opportunity should offer_ to which ahab answered__aye__ straightway_ then_ gabriel once more started to his feet_ glaring upon the old man_ and vehemently exclaimed_ with downward pointed finger__think_ think of the blasphemer_dead_ and down there__beware of the blasphemer_s end__ ahab stolidly turned aside_ then said to mayhew_ _captain_ i have just bethought me of my letter_bag_ there is a letter for one of thy officers_ if i mistake not_ starbuck_ look over the bag__ every whale_ship takes out a goodly number of letters for various ships_ whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed_ depends upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans_ thus_ most letters never reach their mark_ and many are only received after attaining an age of two or three years or more_ soon starbuck returned with a letter in his hand_ it was sorely tumbled_ damp_ and covered with a dull_ spotted_ green mould_ in consequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin_ of such a letter_ death himself might well have been the post_boy_ _can_st not read it__ cried ahab_ _give it me_ man_ aye_ aye_ it_s but a dim scrawl__what_s this__ as he was studying it out_ starbuck took a long cutting_spade pole_ and with his knife slightly split the end_ to insert the letter there_ and in that way_ hand it to the boat_ without its coming any closer to the ship_ meantime_ ahab holding the letter_ muttered_ _mr_ har_yes_ mr_ harry__a woman_s pinny hand__the man_s wife_ i_ll wager__aye_mr_ harry macey_ ship jeroboam__why it_s macey_ and he_s dead__ _poor fellow_ poor fellow_ and from his wife__ sighed mayhew_ _but let me have it__ _nay_ keep it thyself__ cried gabriel to ahab_ _thou art soon going that way__ _curses throttle thee__ yelled ahab_ _captain mayhew_ stand by now to receive it__ and taking the fatal missive from starbuck_s hands_ he caught it in the slit of the pole_ and reached it over towards the boat_ but as he did so_ the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing_ the boat drifted a little towards the ship_s stern_ so that_ as if by magic_ the letter suddenly ranged along with gabriel_s eager hand_ he clutched it in an instant_ seized the boat_knife_ and impaling the letter on it_ sent it thus loaded back into the ship_ it fell at ahab_s feet_ then gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their oars_ and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the pequod_ as_ after this interlude_ the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket of the whale_ many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild affair_ chapter ___ the monkey_rope_ in the tumultuous business of cutting_in and attending to a whale_ there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew_ now hands are wanted here_ and then again hands are wanted there_ there is no staying in any one place_ for at one and the same time everything has to be done everywhere_ it is much the same with him who endeavors the description of the scene_ we must now retrace our way a little_ it was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale_s back_ the blubber_hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates_ but how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole_ it was inserted there by my particular friend queequeg_ whose duty it was_ as harpooneer_ to descend upon the monster_s back for the special purpose referred to_ but in very many cases_ circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole flensing or stripping operation is concluded_ the whale_ be it observed_ lies almost entirely submerged_ excepting the immediate parts operated upon_ so down there_ some ten feet below the level of the deck_ the poor harpooneer flounders about_ half on the whale and half in the water_ as the vast mass revolves like a tread_mill beneath him_ on the occasion in question_ queequeg figured in the highland costume_a shirt and socks_in which to my eyes_ at least_ he appeared to uncommon advantage_ and no one had a better chance to observe him_ as will presently be seen_ being the savage_s bowsman_ that is_ the person who pulled the bow_oar in his boat _the second one from forward__ it was my cheerful duty to attend upon him while taking that hard_scrabble scramble upon the dead whale_s back_ you have seen italian organ_boys holding a dancing_ape by a long cord_ just so_ from the ship_s steep side_ did i hold queequeg down there in the sea_ by what is technically called in the fishery a monkey_rope_ attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his waist_ it was a humorously perilous business for both of us_ for_ before we proceed further_ it must be said that the monkey_rope was fast at both ends_ fast to queequeg_s broad canvas belt_ and fast to my narrow leather one_ so that for better or for worse_ we two_ for the time_ were wedded_ and should poor queequeg sink to rise no more_ then both usage and honour demanded_ that instead of cutting the cord_ it should drag me down in his wake_ so_ then_ an elongated siamese ligature united us_ queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother_ nor could i any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond entailed_ so strongly and metaphysically did i conceive of my situation then_ that while earnestly watching his motions_ i seemed distinctly to perceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock company of two_ that my free will had received a mortal wound_ and that another_s mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster and death_ therefore_ i saw that here was a sort of interregnum in providence_ for its even_handed equity never could have so gross an injustice_ and yet still further pondering_while i jerked him now and then from between the whale and ship_ which would threaten to jam him_still further pondering_ i say_ i saw that this situation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes_ only_ in most cases_ he_ one way or other_ has this siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortals_ if your banker breaks_ you snap_ if your apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills_ you die_ true_ you may say that_ by exceeding caution_ you may possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chances of life_ but handle queequeg_s monkey_rope heedfully as i would_ sometimes he jerked it so_ that i came very near sliding overboard_ nor could i possibly forget that_ do what i would_ i only had the management of one end of it__ _the monkey_rope is found in all whalers_ but it was only in the pequod that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together_ this improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man than stubb_ in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his monkey_rope holder_ i have hinted that i would often jerk poor queequeg from between the whale and the ship_where he would occasionally fall_ from the incessant rolling and swaying of both_ but this was not the only jamming jeopardy he was exposed to_ unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the night_ the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before pent blood which began to flow from the carcass_the rabid creatures swarmed round it like bees in a beehive_ and right in among those sharks was queequeg_ who often pushed them aside with his floundering feet_ a thing altogether incredible were it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale_ the otherwise miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man_ nevertheless_ it may well be believed that since they have such a ravenous finger in the pie_ it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them_ accordingly_ besides the monkey_rope_ with which i now and then jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed a peculiarly ferocious shark_he was provided with still another protection_ suspended over the side in one of the stages_ tashtego and daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen whale_spades_ wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could reach_ this procedure of theirs_ to be sure_ was very disinterested and benevolent of them_ they meant queequeg_s best happiness_ i admit_ but in their hasty zeal to befriend him_ and from the circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the blood_muddled water_ those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg than a tail_ but poor queequeg_ i suppose_ straining and gasping there with that great iron hook_poor queequeg_ i suppose_ only prayed to his yojo_ and gave up his life into the hands of his gods_ well_ well_ my dear comrade and twin_brother_ thought i_ as i drew in and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea_what matters it_ after all_ are you not the precious image of each and all of us men in this whaling world_ that unsounded ocean you gasp in_ is life_ those sharks_ your foes_ those spades_ your friends_ and what between sharks and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril_ poor lad_ but courage_ there is good cheer in store for you_ queequeg_ for now_ as with blue lips and blood_shot eyes the exhausted savage at last climbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily trembling over the side_ the steward advances_ and with a benevolent_ consolatory glance hands him_what_ some hot cognac_ no_ hands him_ ye gods_ hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water_ _ginger_ do i smell ginger__ suspiciously asked stubb_ coming near_ _yes_ this must be ginger__ peering into the as yet untasted cup_ then standing as if incredulous for a while_ he calmly walked towards the astonished steward slowly saying_ _ginger_ ginger_ and will you have the goodness to tell me_ mr_ dough_boy_ where lies the virtue of ginger_ ginger_ is ginger the sort of fuel you use_ dough_boy_ to kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal_ ginger__what the devil is ginger_ sea_coal_ firewood__lucifer matches__tinder__gunpowder__what the devil is ginger_ i say_ that you offer this cup to our poor queequeg here__ _there is some sneaking temperance society movement about this business__ he suddenly added_ now approaching starbuck_ who had just come from forward_ _will you look at that kannakin_ sir_ smell of it_ if you please__ then watching the mate_s countenance_ he added_ _the steward_ mr_ starbuck_ had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to queequeg_ there_ this instant off the whale_ is the steward an apothecary_ sir_ and may i ask whether this is the sort of bitters by which he blows back the life into a half_drowned man__ _i trust not__ said starbuck_ _it is poor stuff enough__ _aye_ aye_ steward__ cried stubb_ _we_ll teach you to drug a harpooneer_ none of your apothecary_s medicine here_ you want to poison us_ do ye_ you have got out insurances on our lives and want to murder us all_ and pocket the proceeds_ do ye__ _it was not me__ cried dough_boy_ _it was aunt charity that brought the ginger on board_ and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits_ but only this ginger_jub_so she called it__ _ginger_jub_ you gingerly rascal_ take that_ and run along with ye to the lockers_ and get something better_ i hope i do no wrong_ mr_ starbuck_ it is the captain_s orders_grog for the harpooneer on a whale__ _enough__ replied starbuck_ _only don_t hit him again_ but__ _oh_ i never hurt when i hit_ except when i hit a whale or something of that sort_ and this fellow_s a weazel_ what were you about saying_ sir__ _only this_ go down with him_ and get what thou wantest thyself__ when stubb reappeared_ he came with a dark flask in one hand_ and a sort of tea_caddy in the other_ the first contained strong spirits_ and was handed to queequeg_ the second was aunt charity_s gift_ and that was freely given to the waves_ chapter ___ stubb and flask kill a right whale_ and then have a talk over him_ it must be borne in mind that all this time we have a sperm whale_s prodigious head hanging to the pequod_s side_ but we must let it continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it_ for the present other matters press_ and the best we can do now for the head_ is to pray heaven the tackles may hold_ now_ during the past night and forenoon_ the pequod had gradually drifted into a sea_ which_ by its occasional patches of yellow brit_ gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of right whales_ a species of the leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking anywhere near_ and though all hands commonly disdained the capture of those inferior creatures_ and though the pequod was not commissioned to cruise for them at all_ and though she had passed numbers of them near the crozetts without lowering a boat_ yet now that a sperm whale had been brought alongside and beheaded_ to the surprise of all_ the announcement was made that a right whale should be captured that day_ if opportunity offered_ nor was this long wanting_ tall spouts were seen to leeward_ and two boats_ stubb_s and flask_s_ were detached in pursuit_ pulling further and further away_ they at last became almost invisible to the men at the mast_head_ but suddenly in the distance_ they saw a great heap of tumultuous white water_ and soon after news came from aloft that one or both the boats must be fast_ an interval passed and the boats were in plain sight_ in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the towing whale_ so close did the monster come to the hull_ that at first it seemed as if he meant it malice_ but suddenly going down in a maelstrom_ within three rods of the planks_ he wholly disappeared from view_ as if diving under the keel_ _cut_ cut__ was the cry from the ship to the boats_ which_ for one instant_ seemed on the point of being brought with a deadly dash against the vessel_s side_ but having plenty of line yet in the tubs_ and the whale not sounding very rapidly_ they paid out abundance of rope_ and at the same time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the ship_ for a few minutes the struggle was intensely critical_ for while they still slacked out the tightened line in one direction_ and still plied their oars in another_ the contending strain threatened to take them under_ but it was only a few feet advance they sought to gain_ and they stuck to it till they did gain it_ when instantly_ a swift tremor was felt running like lightning along the keel_ as the strained line_ scraping beneath the ship_ suddenly rose to view under her bows_ snapping and quivering_ and so flinging off its drippings_ that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water_ while the whale beyond also rose to sight_ and once more the boats were free to fly_ but the fagged whale abated his speed_ and blindly altering his course_ went round the stern of the ship towing the two boats after him_ so that they performed a complete circuit_ meantime_ they hauled more and more upon their lines_ till close flanking him on both sides_ stubb answered flask with lance for lance_ and thus round and round the pequod the battle went_ while the multitudes of sharks that had before swum round the sperm whale_s body_ rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled_ thirstily drinking at every new gash_ as the eager israelites did at the new bursting fountains that poured from the smitten rock_ at last his spout grew thick_ and with a frightful roll and vomit_ he turned upon his back a corpse_ while the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes_ and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing_ some conversation ensued between them_ _i wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard__ said stubb_ not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so ignoble a leviathan_ _wants with it__ said flask_ coiling some spare line in the boat_s bow_ _did you never hear that the ship which but once has a sperm whale_s head hoisted on her starboard side_ and at the same time a right whale_s on the larboard_ did you never hear_ stubb_ that that ship can never afterwards capsize__ _why not_ _i don_t know_ but i heard that gamboge ghost of a fedallah saying so_ and he seems to know all about ships_ charms_ but i sometimes think he_ll charm the ship to no good at last_ i don_t half like that chap_ stubb_ did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved into a snake_s head_ stubb__ _sink him_ i never look at him at all_ but if ever i get a chance of a dark night_ and he standing hard by the bulwarks_ and no one by_ look down there_ flask__pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both hands__aye_ will i_ flask_ i take that fedallah to be the devil in disguise_ do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been stowed away on board ship_ he_s the devil_ i say_ the reason why you don_t see his tail_ is because he tucks it up out of sight_ he carries it coiled away in his pocket_ i guess_ blast him_ now that i think of it_ he_s always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots__ _he sleeps in his boots_ don_t he_ he

trying to come round him_ and get him to swap away his silver watch_ or his soul_ or something of that sort_ and then he_ll surrender moby dick__ _pooh_ stubb_ you are skylarking_ how can fedallah do that__ _i don_t know_ flask_ but the devil is a curious chap_ and a wicked one_ i tell ye_ why_ they say as how he went a sauntering into the old flag_ship once_ switching his tail about devilish easy and gentlemanlike_ and inquiring if the old governor was at home_ well_ he was at home_ and asked the devil what he wanted_ the devil_ switching his hoofs_ up and says_ _i want john__ _what for__ says the old governor_ _what business is that of yours__ says the devil_ getting mad___i want to use him__ _take him__ says the governor_and by the lord_ flask_ if the devil didn_t give john the asiatic cholera before he got through with him_ i_ll eat this whale in one mouthful_ but look sharp_ain_t you all ready there_ well_ then_ pull ahead_ and let_s get the whale alongside__ _i think i remember some such story as you were telling__ said flask_ when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden towards the ship_ _but i can_t remember where__ _three spaniards_ adventures of those three bloody_minded soladoes_ did ye read it there_ flask_ i guess ye did__ _no_ never saw such a book_ heard of it_ though_ but now_ tell me_ stubb_ do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now_ was the same you say is now on board the pequod__ _am i the same man that helped kill this whale_ doesn_t the devil live for ever_ who ever heard that the devil was dead_ did you ever see any parson a wearing mourning for the devil_ and if the devil has a latch_key to get into the admiral_s cabin_ don_t you suppose he can crawl into a porthole_ tell me that_ mr_ flask__ _how old do you suppose fedallah is_ stubb__ _do you see that mainmast there__ pointing to the ship_ _well_ that_s the figure one_ now take all the hoops in the pequod_s hold_ and string along in a row with that mast_ for oughts_ do you see_ well_ that wouldn_t begin to be fedallah_s age_ nor all the coopers in creation couldn_t show hoops enough to make oughts enough__ _but see here_ stubb_ i thought you a little boasted just now_ that you meant to give fedallah a sea_toss_ if you got a good chance_ now_ if he_s so old as all those hoops of yours come to_ and if he is going to live for ever_ what good will it do to pitch him overboard_tell me that_ _give him a good ducking_ anyhow__ _but he_d crawl back__ _duck him again_ and keep ducking him__ _suppose he should take it into his head to duck you_ though_yes_ and drown you_what then__ _i should like to see him try it_ i_d give him such a pair of black eyes that he wouldn_t dare to show his face in the admiral_s cabin again for a long while_ let alone down in the orlop there_ where he lives_ and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much_ damn the devil_ flask_ so you suppose i_m afraid of the devil_ who_s afraid of him_ except the old governor who daresn_t catch him and put him in double_darbies_ as he deserves_ but lets him go about kidnapping people_ aye_ and signed a bond with him_ that all the people the devil kidnapped_ he_d roast for him_ there_s a governor__ _do you suppose fedallah wants to kidnap captain ahab__ _do i suppose it_ you_ll know it before long_ flask_ but i am going now to keep a sharp look_out on him_ and if i see anything very suspicious going on_ i_ll just take him by the nape of his neck_ and say_look here_ beelzebub_ you don_t do it_ and if he makes any fuss_ by the lord i_ll make a grab into his pocket for his tail_ take it to the capstan_ and give him such a wrenching and heaving_ that his tail will come short off at the stump_do you see_ and then_ i rather guess when he finds himself docked in that queer fashion_ he_ll sneak off without the poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs__ _and what will you do with the tail_ stubb__ _do with it_ sell it for an ox whip when we get home__what else__ _now_ do you mean what you say_ and have been saying all along_ stubb__ _mean or not mean_ here we are at the ship__ the boats were here hailed_ to tow the whale on the larboard side_ where fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for securing him_ _didn_t i tell you so__ said flask_ _yes_ you_ll soon see this right whale_s head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti_s__ in good time_ flask_s saying proved true_ as before_ the pequod steeply leaned over towards the sperm whale_s head_ now_ by the counterpoise of both heads_ she regained her even keel_ though sorely strained_ you may well believe_ so_ when on one side you hoist in locke_s head_ you go over that way_ but now_ on the other side_ hoist in kant_s and you come back again_ but in very poor plight_ thus_ some minds for ever keep trimming boat_ oh_ ye foolish_ throw all these thunder_heads overboard_ and then you will float light and right_ in disposing of the body of a right whale_ when brought alongside the ship_ the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the case of a sperm whale_ only_ in the latter instance_ the head is cut off whole_ but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed and hoisted on deck_ with all the well known black bone attached to what is called the crown_piece_ but nothing like this_ in the present case_ had been done_ the carcases of both whales had dropped astern_ and the head_laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair of overburdening panniers_ meantime_ fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale_s head_ and ever and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own hand_ and ahab chanced so to stand_ that the parsee occupied his shadow_ while_ if the parsee_s shadow was there at all it seemed only to blend with_ and lengthen ahab_s_ as the crew toiled on_ laplandish speculations were bandied among them_ concerning all these passing things_ chapter ___ the sperm whale_s head_contrasted view_ here_ now_ are two great whales_ laying their heads together_ let us join them_ and lay together our own_ of the grand order of folio leviathans_ the sperm whale and the right whale are by far the most noteworthy_ they are the only whales regularly hunted by man_ to the nantucketer_ they present the two extremes of all the known varieties of the whale_ as the external difference between them is mainly observable in their heads_ and as a head of each is this moment hanging from the pequod_s side_ and as we may freely go from one to the other_ by merely stepping across the deck__where_ i should like to know_ will you obtain a better chance to study practical cetology than here_ in the first place_ you are struck by the general contrast between these heads_ both are massive enough in all conscience_ but there is a certain mathematical symmetry in the sperm whale_s which the right whale_s sadly lacks_ there is more character in the sperm whale_s head_ as you behold it_ you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him_ in point of pervading dignity_ in the present instance_ too_ this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit_ giving token of advanced age and large experience_ in short_ he is what the fishermen technically call a _grey_headed whale__ let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads_namely_ the two most important organs_ the eye and the ear_ far back on the side of the head_ and low down_ near the angle of either whale_s jaw_ if you narrowly search_ you will at last see a lashless eye_ which you would fancy to be a young colt_s eye_ so out of all proportion is it to the magnitude of the head_ now_ from this peculiar sideway position of the whale_s eyes_ it is plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead_ no more than he can one exactly astern_ in a word_ the position of the whale_s eyes corresponds to that of a man_s ears_ and you may fancy_ for yourself_ how it would fare with you_ did you sideways survey objects through your ears_ you would find that you could only command some thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight side_line of sight_ and about thirty more behind it_ if your bitterest foe were walking straight towards you_ with dagger uplifted in broad day_ you would not be able to see him_ any more than if he were stealing upon you from behind_ in a word_ you would have two backs_ so to speak_ but_ at the same time_ also_ two fronts _side fronts__ for what is it that makes the front of a man_what_ indeed_ but his eyes_ moreover_ while in most other animals that i can now think of_ the eyes are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power_ so as to produce one picture and not two to the brain_ the peculiar position of the whale_s eyes_ effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of solid head_ which towers between them like a great mountain separating two lakes in valleys_ this_ of course_ must wholly separate the impressions which each independent organ imparts_ the whale_ therefore_ must see one distinct picture on this side_ and another distinct picture on that side_ while all between must be profound darkness and nothingness to him_ man may_ in effect_ be said to look out on the world from a sentry_box with two joined sashes for his window_ but with the whale_ these two sashes are separately inserted_ making two distinct windows_ but sadly impairing the view_ this peculiarity of the whale_s eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery_ and to be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes_ a curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this visual matter as touching the leviathan_ but i must be content with a hint_ so long as a man_s eyes are open in the light_ the act of seeing is involuntary_ that is_ he cannot then help mechanically seeing whatever objects are before him_ nevertheless_ any one_s experience will teach him_ that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of things at one glance_ it is quite impossible for him_ attentively_ and completely_ to examine any two things_however large or however small_at one and the same instant of time_ never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other_ but if you now come to separate these two objects_ and surround each by a circle of profound darkness_ then_ in order to see one of them_ in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it_ the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness_ how is it_ then_ with the whale_ true_ both his eyes_ in themselves_ must simultaneously act_ but is his brain so much more comprehensive_ combining_ and subtle than man_s_ that he can at the same moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects_ one on one side of him_ and the other in an exactly opposite direction_ if he can_ then is it as marvellous a thing in him_ as if a man were able simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct problems in euclid_ nor_ strictly investigated_ is there any incongruity in this comparison_ it may be but an idle whim_ but it has always seemed to me_ that the extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when beset by three or four boats_ the timidity and liability to queer frights_ so common to such whales_ i think that all this indirectly proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition_ in which their divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them_ but the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye_ if you are an entire stranger to their race_ you might hunt over these two heads for hours_ and never discover that organ_ the ear has no external leaf whatever_ and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill_ so wondrously minute is it_ it is lodged a little behind the eye_ with respect to their ears_ this important difference is to be observed between the sperm whale and the right_ while the ear of the former has an external opening_ that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered over with a membrane_ so as to be quite imperceptible from without_ is it not curious_ that so vast a being as the whale should see the world through so small an eye_ and hear the thunder through an ear which is smaller than a hare_s_ but if his eyes were broad as the lens of herschel_s great telescope_ and his ears capacious as the porches of cathedrals_ would that make him any longer of sight_ or sharper of hearing_ not at all__why then do you try to _enlarge_ your mind_ subtilize it_ let us now with whatever levers and steam_engines we have at hand_ cant over the sperm whale_s head_ that it may lie bottom up_ then_ ascending by a ladder to the summit_ have a peep down the mouth_ and were it not that the body is now completely separated from it_ with a lantern we might descend into the great kentucky mammoth cave of his stomach_ but let us hold on here by this tooth_ and look about us where we are_ what a really beautiful and chaste_looking mouth_ from floor to ceiling_ lined_ or rather papered with a glistening white membrane_ glossy as bridal satins_ but come out now_ and look at this portentous lower jaw_ which seems like the long narrow lid of an immense snuff_box_ with the hinge at one end_ instead of one side_ if you pry it up_ so as to get it overhead_ and expose its rows of teeth_ it seems a terrific portcullis_ and such_ alas_ it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery_ upon whom these spikes fall with impaling force_ but far more terrible is it to behold_ when fathoms down in the sea_ you see some sulky whale_ floating there suspended_ with his prodigious jaw_ some fifteen feet long_ hanging straight down at right_angles with his body_ for all the world like a ship_s jib_boom_ this whale is not dead_ he is only dispirited_ out of sorts_ perhaps_ hypochondriac_ and so supine_ that the hinges of his jaw have relaxed_ leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight_ a reproach to all his tribe_ who must_ no doubt_ imprecate lock_jaws upon him_ in most cases this lower jaw_being easily unhinged by a practised artist_is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting the ivory teeth_ and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles_ including canes_ umbrella_stocks_ and handles to riding_whips_ with a long_ weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board_ as if it were an anchor_ and when the proper time comes_some few days after the other work_queequeg_ daggoo_ and tashtego_ being all accomplished dentists_ are set to drawing teeth_ with a keen cutting_spade_ queequeg lances the gums_ then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts_ and a tackle being rigged from aloft_ they drag out these teeth_ as michigan oxen drag stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands_ there are generally forty_two teeth in all_ in old whales_ much worn down_ but undecayed_ nor filled after our artificial fashion_ the jaw is afterwards sawn into slabs_ and piled away like joists for building houses_ chapter ___ the right whale_s head_contrasted view_ crossing the deck_ let us now have a good long look at the right whale_s head_ as in general shape the noble sperm whale_s head may be compared to a roman war_chariot _especially in front_ where it is so broadly rounded__ so_ at a broad view_ the right whale_s head bears a rather inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot_toed shoe_ two hundred years ago an old dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a shoemaker_s last_ and in this same last or shoe_ that old woman of the nursery tale_ with the swarming brood_ might very comfortably be lodged_ she and all her progeny_ but as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different aspects_ according to your point of view_ if you stand on its summit and look at these two f_shaped spoutholes_ you would take the whole head for an enormous bass_viol_ and these spiracles_ the apertures in its sounding_board_ then_ again_ if you fix your eye upon this strange_ crested_ comb_like incrustation on the top of the mass_this green_ barnacled thing_ which the greenlanders call the _crown__ and the southern fishers the _bonnet_ of the right whale_ fixing your eyes solely on this_ you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak_ with a bird_s nest in its crotch_ at any rate_ when you watch those live crabs that nestle here on this bonnet_ such an idea will be almost sure to occur to you_ unless_ indeed_ your fancy has been fixed by the technical term _crown_ also bestowed upon it_ in which case you will take great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a diademed king of the sea_ whose green crown has been put together for him in this marvellous manner_ but if this whale be a king_ he is a very sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem_ look at that hanging lower lip_ what a huge sulk and pout is there_ a sulk and pout_ by carpenter_s measurement_ about twenty feet long and five feet deep_ a sulk and pout that will yield you some ___ gallons of oil and more_ a great pity_ now_ that this unfortunate whale should be hare_lipped_ the fissure is about a foot across_ probably the mother during an important interval was sailing down the peruvian coast_ when earthquakes caused the beach to gape_ over this lip_ as over a slippery threshold_ we now slide into the mouth_ upon my word were i at mackinaw_ i should take this to be the inside of an indian wigwam_ good lord_ is this the road that jonah went_ the roof is about twelve feet high_ and runs to a pretty sharp angle_ as if there were a regular ridge_pole there_ while these ribbed_ arched_ hairy sides_ present us with those wondrous_ half vertical_ scimetar_shaped slats of whalebone_ say three hundred on a side_ which depending from the upper part of the head or crown bone_ form those venetian blinds which have elsewhere been cursorily mentioned_ the edges of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres_ through which the right whale strains the water_ and in whose intricacies he retains the small fish_ when openmouthed he goes through the seas of brit in feeding time_ in the central blinds of bone_ as they stand in their natural order_ there are certain curious marks_ curves_ hollows_ and ridges_ whereby some whalemen calculate the creature_s age_ as the age of an oak by its circular rings_ though the certainty of this criterion is far from demonstrable_ yet it has the savor of analogical probability_ at any rate_ if we yield to it_ we must grant a far greater age to the right whale than at first glance will seem reasonable_ in old times_ there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies concerning these blinds_ one voyager in purchas calls them the wondrous _whiskers_ inside of the whale_s mouth__ another_ _hogs_ bristles__ a third old gentleman in hackluyt uses the following elegant language_ _there are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his upper chop_ which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth__ _this reminds us that the right whale really has a sort of whisker_ or rather a moustache_ consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw_ sometimes these tufts impart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn countenance_ as every one knows_ these same _hogs_ bristles__ _fins__ _whiskers__ _blinds__ or whatever you please_ furnish to the ladies their busks and other stiffening contrivances_ but in this particular_ the demand has long been on the decline_ it was in queen anne_s time that the bone was in its glory_ the farthingale being then all the fashion_ and as those ancient dames moved about gaily_ though in the jaws of the whale_ as you may say_ even so_ in a shower_ with the like thoughtlessness_ do we nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection_ the umbrella being a tent spread over the same bone_ but now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment_ and_ standing in the right whale_s mouth_ look around you afresh_ seeing all these colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about_ would you not think you were inside of the great haarlem organ_ and gazing upon its thousand pipes_ for a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest turkey_the tongue_ which is glued_ as it were_ to the floor of the mouth_ it is very fat and tender_ and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting it on deck_ this particular tongue now before us_ at a passing glance i should say it was a six_barreler_ that is_ it will yield you about that amount of oil_ ere this_ you must have plainly seen the truth of what i started with_that the sperm whale and the right whale have almost entirely different heads_ to sum up_ then_ in the right whale_s there is no great well of sperm_ no ivory teeth at all_ no long_ slender mandible of a lower jaw_ like the sperm whale_s_ nor in the sperm whale are there any of those blinds of bone_ no huge lower lip_ and scarcely anything of a tongue_ again_ the right whale has two external spout_holes_ the sperm whale only one_ look your last_ now_ on these venerable hooded heads_ while they yet lie together_ for one will soon sink_ unrecorded_ in the sea_ the other will not be very long in following_ can you catch the expression of the sperm whale_s there_ it is the same he died with_ only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now faded away_ i think his broad brow to be full of a prairie_like placidity_ born of a speculative indifference as to death_ but mark the other head_s expression_ see that amazing lower lip_ pressed by accident against the vessel_s side_ so as firmly to embrace the jaw_ does not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in facing death_ this right whale i take to have been a stoic_ the sperm whale_ a platonian_ who might have taken up spinoza in his latter years_ chapter ___ the battering_ram_ ere quitting_ for the nonce_ the sperm whale_s head_ i would have you_ as a sensible physiologist_ simply_particularly remark its front aspect_ in all its compacted collectedness_ i would have you investigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some unexaggerated_ intelligent estimate of whatever battering_ram power may be lodged there_ here is a vital point_ for you must either satisfactorily settle this matter with yourself_ or for ever remain an infidel as to one of the most appalling_ but not the less true events_ perhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history_ you observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the sperm whale_ the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the water_ you observe that the lower part of that front slopes considerably backwards_ so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long socket which receives the boom_like lower jaw_ you observe that the mouth is entirely under the head_ much in the same way_ indeed_ as though your own mouth were entirely under your chin_ moreover you observe that the whale has no external nose_ and that what nose he has_his spout hole_is on the top of his head_ you observe that his eyes and ears are at the sides of his head_ nearly one third of his entire length from the front_ wherefore_ you must now have perceived that the front of the sperm whale_s head is a dead_ blind wall_ without a single organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever_ furthermore_ you are now to consider that only in the extreme_ lower_ backward sloping part of the front of the head_ is there the slightest vestige of bone_ and not till you get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the full cranial development_ so that this whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad_ finally_ though_ as will soon be revealed_ its contents partly comprise the most delicate oil_ yet_ you are now to be apprised of the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests all that apparent effeminacy_ in some previous place i have described to you how the blubber wraps the body of the whale_ as the rind wraps an orange_ just so with the head_ but with this difference_ about the head this envelope_ though not so thick_ is of a boneless toughness_ inestimable by any man who has not handled it_ the severest pointed harpoon_ the sharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm_ impotently rebounds from it_ it is as though the forehead of the sperm whale were paved with horses_ hoofs_ i do not think that any sensation lurks in it_ bethink yourself also of another thing_ when two large_ loaded indiamen chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks_ what do the sailors do_ they do not suspend between them_ at the point of coming contact_ any merely hard substance_ like iron or wood_ no_ they hold there a large_ round wad of tow and cork_ enveloped in the thickest and toughest of ox_hide_ that bravely and uninjured takes the jam which would have snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crow_bars_ by itself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact i drive at_ but supplementary to this_ it has hypothetically occurred to me_ that as ordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder in them_ capable_ at will_ of distension or contraction_ and as the sperm whale_ as far as i know_ has no such provision in him_ considering_ too_ the otherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head altogether beneath the surface_ and anon swims with it high elevated out of the water_ considering the unobstructed elasticity of its envelope_ considering the unique interior of his head_ it has hypothetically occurred to me_ i say_ that those mystical lung_celled honeycombs there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and unsuspected connexion with the outer air_ so as to be susceptible to atmospheric distension and contraction_ if this be so_ fancy the irresistibleness of that might_ to which the most impalpable and destructive of all elements contributes_ now_ mark_ unerringly impelling this dead_ impregnable_ uninjurable wall_ and this most buoyant thing within_ there swims behind it all a mass of tremendous life_ only to be adequately estimated as piled wood is_by the cord_ and all obedient to one volition_ as the smallest insect_ so that when i shall hereafter detail to you all the specialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this expansive monster_ when i shall show you some of his more inconsiderable braining feats_ i trust you will have renounced all ignorant incredulity_ and be ready to abide by this_ that though the sperm whale stove a passage through the isthmus of darien_ and mixed the atlantic with the pacific_ you would not elevate one hair of your eye_brow_ for unless you own the whale_ you are but a provincial and sentimentalist in truth_ but clear truth is a thing for salamander giants only to encounter_ how small the chances for the provincials then_ what befell the weakling youth lifting the dread goddess_s veil at lais_ chapter ___ the great heidelburgh tun_ now comes the baling of the case_ but to comprehend it aright_ you must know something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated upon_ regarding the sperm whale_s head as a solid oblong_ you may_ on an inclined plane_ sideways divide it into two quoins__ whereof the lower is the bony structure_ forming the cranium and jaws_ and the upper an unctuous mass wholly free from bones_ its broad forward end forming the expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale_ at the middle of the forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin_ and then you have two almost equal parts_ which before were naturally divided by an internal wall of a thick tendinous substance_ _quoin is not a euclidean term_ it belongs to the pure nautical mathematics_ i know not that it has been defined before_ a quoin is a solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the steep inclination of one side_ instead of the mutual tapering of both sides_ the lower subdivided part_ called the junk_ is one immense honeycomb of oil_ formed by the crossing and recrossing_ into ten thousand infiltrated cells_ of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole extent_ the upper part_ known as the case_ may be regarded as the great heidelburgh tun of the sperm whale_ and as that famous great tierce is mystically carved in front_ so the whale_s vast plaited forehead forms innumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his wondrous tun_ moreover_ as that of heidelburgh was always replenished with the most excellent of the wines of the rhenish valleys_ so the tun of the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily vintages_ namely_ the highly_prized spermaceti_ in its absolutely pure_ limpid_ and odoriferous state_ nor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other part of the creature_ though in life it remains perfectly fluid_ yet_ upon exposure to the air_ after death_ it soon begins to concrete_ sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots_ as when the first thin delicate ice is just forming in water_ a large whale_s case generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm_ though from unavoidable circumstances_ considerable of it is spilled_ leaks_ and dribbles away_ or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of securing what you can_ i know not with what fine and costly material the heidelburgh tun was coated within_ but in superlative richness that coating could not possibly have compared with the silken pearl_coloured membrane_ like the lining of a fine pelisse_ forming the inner surface of the sperm whale_s case_ it will have been seen that the heidelburgh tun of the sperm whale embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head_ and since_as has been elsewhere set forth_the head embraces one third of the whole length of the creature_ then setting that length down at eighty feet for a good sized whale_ you have more than twenty_six feet for the depth of the tun_ when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a ship_s side_ as in decapitating the whale_ the operator_s instrument is brought close to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the spermaceti magazine_ he has_ therefore_ to be uncommonly heedful_ lest a careless_ untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly let out its invaluable contents_ it is this decapitated end of the head_ also_ which is at last elevated out of the water_ and retained in that position by the enormous cutting tackles_ whose hempen combinations_ on one side_ make quite a wilderness of ropes in that quarter_ thus much being said_ attend now_ i pray you_ to that marvellous and_in this particular instance_almost fatal operation whereby the sperm whale_s great heidelburgh tun is tapped_ chapter ___ cistern and buckets_ nimble as a cat_ tashtego mounts aloft_ and without altering his erect posture_ runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard_arm_ to the part where it exactly projects over the hoisted tun_ he has carried with him a light tackle called a whip_ consisting of only two parts_ travelling through a single_sheaved block_ securing this block_ so that it hangs down from the yard_arm_ he swings one end of the rope_ till it is caught and firmly held by a hand on deck_ then_ hand_over_hand_ down the other part_ the indian drops through the air_ till dexterously he lands on the summit of the head_ there_still high elevated above the rest of the company_ to whom he vivaciously cries_he seems some turkish muezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower_ a short_handled sharp spade being sent up to him_ he diligently searches for the proper place to begin breaking into the tun_ in this business he proceeds very heedfully_ like a treasure_hunter in some old house_ sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in_ by the time this cautious search is over_ a stout iron_bound bucket_ precisely like a well_bucket_ has been attached to one end of the whip_ while the other end_ being stretched across the deck_ is there held by two or three alert hands_ these last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the indian_ to whom another person has reached up a very long pole_ inserting this pole into the bucket_ tashtego downward guides the bucket into the tun_ till it entirely disappears_ then giving the word to the seamen at the whip_ up comes the bucket again_ all bubbling like a dairy_maid_s pail of new milk_ carefully lowered from its height_ the full_freighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand_ and quickly emptied into a large tub_ then remounting aloft_ it again goes through the same round until the deep cistern will yield no more_ towards the end_ tashtego has to ram his long pole harder and harder_ and deeper and deeper into the tun_ until some twenty feet of the pole have gone down_ now_ the people of the pequod had been baling some time in this way_ several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm_ when all at once a queer accident happened_ whether it was that tashtego_ that wild indian_ was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his one_handed hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head_ or whether the place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy_ or whether the evil one himself would have it to fall out so_ without stating his particular reasons_ how it was exactly_ there is no telling now_ but_ on a sudden_ as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came suckingly up_my god_ poor tashtego_like the twin reciprocating bucket in a veritable well_ dropped head_foremost down into this great tun of heidelburgh_ and with a horrible oily gurgling_ went clean out of sight_ _man overboard__ cried daggoo_ who amid the general consternation first came to his senses_ _swing the bucket this way__ and putting one foot into it_ so as the better to secure his slippery hand_hold on the whip itself_ the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head_ almost before tashtego could have reached its interior bottom_ meantime_ there was a terrible tumult_ looking over the side_ they saw the before lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea_ as if that moment seized with some momentous idea_ whereas it was only the poor indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous depth to which he had sunk_ at this instant_ while daggoo_ on the summit of the head_ was clearing the whip_which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles_a sharp cracking noise was heard_ and to the unspeakable horror of all_ one of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out_ and with a vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung_ till the drunk ship reeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg_ the one remaining hook_ upon which the entire strain now depended_ seemed every instant to be on the point of giving way_ an event still more likely from the violent motions of the head_ _come down_ come down__ yelled the seamen to daggoo_ but with one hand holding on to the heavy tackles_ so that if the head should drop_ he would still remain suspended_ the negro having cleared the foul line_ rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well_ meaning that the buried harpooneer should grasp it_ and so be hoisted out_ _in heaven_s name_ man__ cried stubb_ _are you ramming home a cartridge there__avast_ how will that help him_ jamming that iron_bound bucket on top of his head_ avast_ will ye__ _stand clear of the tackle__ cried a voice like the bursting of a rocket_ almost in the same instant_ with a thunder_boom_ the enormous mass dropped into the sea_ like niagara_s table_rock into the whirlpool_ the suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it_ to far down her glittering copper_ and all caught their breath_ as half swinging_now over the sailors_ heads_ and now over the water_daggoo_ through a thick mist of spray_ was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles_ while poor_ buried_alive tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of the sea_ but hardly had the blinding vapour cleared away_ when a naked figure with a boarding_sword in his hand_ was for one swift moment seen hovering over the bulwarks_ the next_ a loud splash announced that my brave queequeg had dived to the rescue_ one packed rush was made to the side_ and every eye counted every ripple_ as moment followed moment_ and no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen_ some hands now jumped into a boat alongside_ and pushed a little off from the ship_ _ha_ ha__ cried daggoo_ all at once_ from his now quiet_ swinging perch overhead_ and looking further off from the side_ we saw an arm thrust upright from the blue waves_ a sight strange to see_ as an arm thrust forth from the grass over a grave_ _both_ both__it is both___cried daggoo again with a joyful shout_ and soon after_ queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand_ and with the other clutching the long hair of the indian_ drawn into the waiting boat_ they were quickly brought to the deck_ but tashtego was long in coming to_ and queequeg did not look very brisk_ now_ how had this noble rescue been accomplished_ why_ diving after the slowly descending head_ queequeg with his keen sword had made side lunges near its bottom_ so as to scuttle a large hole there_ then dropping his sword_ had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards_ and so hauled out poor tash by the head_ he averred_ that upon first thrusting in for him_ a leg was presented_ but well knowing that that was not as it ought to be_ and might occasion great trouble__he had thrust back the leg_ and by a dexterous heave and toss_ had wrought a somerset upon the indian_ so that with the next trial_ he came forth in the good old way_head foremost_ as for the great head itself_ that was doing as well as could be expected_ and thus_ through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of queequeg_ the deliverance_ or rather_ delivery of tashtego_ was successfully accomplished_ in the teeth_ too_ of the most untoward and apparently hopeless impediments_ which is a lesson by no means to be forgotten_ midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing and boxing_ riding and rowing_ i know that this queer adventure of the gay_header_s will be sure to seem incredible to some landsmen_ though they themselves may have either seen or heard of some one_s falling into a cistern ashore_ an accident which not seldom happens_ and with much less reason too than the indian_s_ considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the sperm whale_s well_ but_ peradventure_ it may be sagaciously urged_ how is this_ we thought the tissued_ infiltrated head of the sperm whale_ was the lightest and most corky part about him_ and yet thou makest it sink in an element of a far greater specific gravity than itself_ we have thee there_ not at all_ but i have ye_ for at the time poor tash fell in_ the case had been nearly emptied of its lighter contents_ leaving little but the dense tendinous wall of the well_a double welded_ hammered substance_ as i have before said_ much heavier than the sea water_ and a lump of which sinks in it like lead almost_ but the tendency to rapid sinking in this substance was in the present instance materially counteracted by the other parts of the head remaining undetached from it_ so that it sank very slowly and deliberately indeed_ affording queequeg a fair chance for performing his agile obstetrics on the run_ as you may say_ yes_ it was a running delivery_ so it was_ now_ had tashtego perished in that head_ it had been a very precious perishing_ smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant spermaceti_ coffined_ hearsed_ and tombed in the secret inner chamber and sanctum

that leaning too far over_ it sucked him in_ so that he died embalmed_ how many_ think ye_ have likewise fallen into plato_s honey head_ and sweetly perished there_ chapter ___ the prairie_ to scan the lines of his face_ or feel the bumps on the head of this leviathan_ this is a thing which no physiognomist or phrenologist has as yet undertaken_ such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as for lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the rock of gibraltar_ or for gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the dome of the pantheon_ still_ in that famous work of his_ lavater not only treats of the various faces of men_ but also attentively studies the faces of horses_ birds_ serpents_ and fish_ and dwells in detail upon the modifications of expression discernible therein_ nor have gall and his disciple spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching the phrenological characteristics of other beings than man_ therefore_ though i am but ill qualified for a pioneer_ in the application of these two semi_sciences to the whale_ i will do my endeavor_ i try all things_ i achieve what i can_ physiognomically regarded_ the sperm whale is an anomalous creature_ he has no proper nose_ and since the nose is the central and most conspicuous of the features_ and since it perhaps most modifies and finally controls their combined expression_ hence it would seem that its entire absence_ as an external appendage_ must very largely affect the countenance of the whale_ for as in landscape gardening_ a spire_ cupola_ monument_ or tower of some sort_ is deemed almost indispensable to the completion of the scene_ so no face can be physiognomically in keeping without the elevated open_work belfry of the nose_ dash the nose from phidias_s marble jove_ and what a sorry remainder_ nevertheless_ leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude_ all his proportions are so stately_ that the same deficiency which in the sculptured jove were hideous_ in him is no blemish at all_ nay_ it is an added grandeur_ a nose to the whale would have been impertinent_ as on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head in your jolly_boat_ your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by the reflection that he has a nose to be pulled_ a pestilent conceit_ which so often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest royal beadle on his throne_ in some particulars_ perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to be had of the sperm whale_ is that of the full front of his head_ this aspect is sublime_ in thought_ a fine human brow is like the east when troubled with the morning_ in the repose of the pasture_ the curled brow of the bull has a touch of the grand in it_ pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles_ the elephant_s brow is majestic_ human or animal_ the mystical brow is as that great golden seal affixed by the german emperors to their decrees_ it signifies__god_ done this day by my hand__ but in most creatures_ nay in man himself_ very often the brow is but a mere strip of alpine land lying along the snow line_ few are the foreheads which like shakespeare_s or melancthon_s rise so high_ and descend so low_ that the eyes themselves seem clear_ eternal_ tideless mountain lakes_ and all above them in the forehead_s wrinkles_ you seem to track the antlered thoughts descending there to drink_ as the highland hunters track the snow prints of the deer_ but in the great sperm whale_ this high and mighty god_like dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified_ that gazing on it_ in that full front view_ you feel the deity and the dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other object in living nature_ for you see no one point precisely_ not one distinct feature is revealed_ no nose_ eyes_ ears_ or mouth_ no face_ he has none_ proper_ nothing but that one broad firmament of a forehead_ pleated with riddles_ dumbly lowering with the doom of boats_ and ships_ and men_ nor_ in profile_ does this wondrous brow diminish_ though that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so_ in profile_ you plainly perceive that horizontal_ semi_crescentic depression in the forehead_s middle_ which_ in man_ is lavater_s mark of genius_ but how_ genius in the sperm whale_ has the sperm whale ever written a book_ spoken a speech_ no_ his great genius is declared in his doing nothing particular to prove it_ it is moreover declared in his pyramidical silence_ and this reminds me that had the great sperm whale been known to the young orient world_ he would have been deified by their child_magian thoughts_ they deified the crocodile of the nile_ because the crocodile is tongueless_ and the sperm whale has no tongue_ or at least it is so exceedingly small_ as to be incapable of protrusion_ if hereafter any highly cultured_ poetical nation shall lure back to their birth_right_ the merry may_day gods of old_ and livingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky_ in the now unhaunted

the nut_ if the sperm whale be physiognomically a sphinx_ to the phrenologist his brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to square_ in the full_grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet in length_ unhinge the lower jaw_ and the side view of this skull is as the side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level base_ but in life_as we have elsewhere seen_this inclined plane is angularly filled up_ and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent mass of the junk and sperm_ at the high end the skull forms a crater to bed that part of the mass_ while under the long floor of this crater_in another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in depth_reposes the mere handful of this monster_s brain_ the brain is at least twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life_ it is hidden away behind its vast outworks_ like the innermost citadel within the amplified fortifications of quebec_ so like a choice casket is it secreted in him_ that i have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny that the sperm whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance of one formed by the cubic_yards of his sperm magazine_ lying in strange folds_ courses_ and convolutions_ to their apprehensions_ it seems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that mystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence_ it is plain_ then_ that phrenologically the head of this leviathan_ in the creature_s living intact state_ is an entire delusion_ as for his true brain_ you can then see no indications of it_ nor feel any_ the whale_ like all things that are mighty_ wears a false brow to the common world_ if you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view of its rear end_ which is the high end_ you will be struck by its resemblance to the human skull_ beheld in the same situation_ and from the same point of view_ indeed_ place this reversed skull _scaled down to the human magnitude_ among a plate of men_s skulls_ and you would involuntarily confound it with them_ and remarking the depressions on one part of its summit_ in phrenological phrase you would say_this man had no self_esteem_ and no veneration_ and by those negations_ considered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and power_ you can best form to yourself the truest_ though not the most exhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is_ but if from the comparative dimensions of the whale_s proper brain_ you deem it incapable of being adequately charted_ then i have another idea for you_ if you attentively regard almost any quadruped_s spine_ you will be struck with the resemblance of its vertebrae to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls_ all bearing rudimental resemblance to the skull proper_ it is a german conceit_ that the vertebrae are absolutely undeveloped skulls_ but the curious external resemblance_ i take it the germans were not the first men to perceive_ a foreign friend once pointed it out to me_ in the skeleton of a foe he had slain_ and with the vertebrae of which he was inlaying_ in a sort of basso_relievo_ the beaked prow of his canoe_ now_ i consider that the phrenologists have omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the cerebellum through the spinal canal_ for i believe that much of a man_s character will be found betokened in his backbone_ i would rather feel your spine than your skull_ whoever you are_ a thin joist of a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul_ i rejoice in my spine_ as in the firm audacious staff of that flag which i fling half out to the world_ apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the sperm whale_ his cranial cavity is continuous with the first neck_vertebra_ and in that vertebra the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across_ being eight in height_ and of a triangular figure with the base downwards_ as it passes through the remaining vertebrae the canal tapers in size_ but for a considerable distance remains of large capacity_ now_ of course_ this canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substance_the spinal cord_as the brain_ and directly communicates with the brain_ and what is still more_ for many feet after emerging from the brain_s cavity_ the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth_ almost equal to that of the brain_ under all these circumstances_ would it be unreasonable to survey and map out the whale_s spine phrenologically_ for_ viewed in this light_ the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his spinal cord_ but leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists_ i would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment_ in reference to the sperm whale_s hump_ this august hump_ if i mistake not_ rises over one of the larger vertebrae_ and is_ therefore_ in some sort_ the outer convex mould of it_ from its relative situation then_ i should call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the sperm whale_ and that the great monster is indomitable_ you will yet have reason to know_

questionable_ for it is not customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social_ nevertheless_ he stuck to their wake_ though indeed their back water must have retarded him_ because the white_bone or swell at his broad muzzle was a dashed one_ like the swell formed when two hostile currents meet_ his spout was short_ slow_ and laborious_ coming forth with a choking sort of gush_ and

nantucket irons entered the whale_ blinding vapours of foam and white_fire_ the three boats_ in the first fury of the whale_s headlong rush_ bumped the german_s aside with such force_ that both derick

everlasting mail__ but the monster_s run was a brief one_ giving a sudden gasp_ he tumultuously sounded_ with a grating rush_ the three lines flew round the loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them_ while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would soon exhaust the lines_ that using all their dexterous might_ they caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on_ till at last_owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead_lined chocks of the boats_ whence the three ropes went straight down into the blue_the gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water_ while the three sterns tilted high in the air_ and the whale soon ceasing to sound_ for some time they remained in that attitude_ fearful of expending more line_ though the position was a little ticklish_ but though boats have been taken down and lost in this way_ yet it is this _holding on__ as it is called_ this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from the back_ this it is that often torments the leviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp lance of his foes_ yet not to speak of the peril of the thing_ it is to be doubted whether this course is always the best_ for it is but reasonable to presume_ that the longer the stricken whale stays under water_ the more he is exhausted_ because_ owing to the enormous surface of him_in a full grown sperm whale something less than ____ square feet_the pressure of the water is immense_ we all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under_ even here_ above_ground_ in the air_ how vast_ then_ the burden of a whale_ bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean_ it must at least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres_ one whaleman has estimated it at the weight of twenty line_of_battle ships_ with all their guns_ and stores_ and men on board_ as the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea_ gazing down into its eternal blue noon_ and as not a single groan or cry of any sort_ nay_ not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths_ what landsman would have thought_ that beneath all that silence and placidity_ the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in agony_ not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows_ seems it credible that by three such thin threads the great leviathan was suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock_ suspended_ and to what_ to three bits of board_ is this the creature of whom it was once so triumphantly said__canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons_ or his head with fish_spears_ the sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold_ the spear_ the dart_ nor the habergeon_ he esteemeth iron as straw_ the arrow cannot make him flee_ darts are counted as stubble_ he laugheth at the shaking of a spear__ this the creature_ this he_ oh_ that unfulfilments should follow the prophets_ for with the strength of a thousand thighs in his tail_ leviathan had run his head under the mountains of the sea_ to hide him from the pequod_s fish_spears_ in that sloping afternoon sunlight_ the shadows that the three boats sent down beneath the surface_ must have been long enough and broad enough to shade half xerxes_ army_ who can tell how appalling to the wounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head_ _stand by_ men_ he stirs__ cried starbuck_ as the three lines suddenly vibrated in the water_ distinctly conducting upwards to them_ as by magnetic wires_ the life and death throbs of the whale_ so that every oarsman felt them in his seat_ the next moment_ relieved in great part from the downward strain at the bows_ the boats gave a sudden bounce upwards_ as a small icefield will_ when a dense herd of white bears are scared from it into the sea_ _haul in_ haul in__ cried starbuck again_ _he_s rising__ the lines_ of which_ hardly an instant before_ not one hand_s breadth could have been gained_ were now in long quick coils flung back all dripping into the boats_ and soon the whale broke water within two ship_s lengths of the hunters_ his motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion_ in most land animals there are certain valves or flood_gates in many of their veins_ whereby when wounded_ the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in certain directions_ not so with the whale_ one of whose peculiarities it is to have an entire non_valvular structure of the blood_vessels_ so that when pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon_ a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial system_ and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance below the surface_ his life may be said to pour from him in incessant streams_ yet so vast is the quantity of blood in him_ and so distant and numerous its interior fountains_ that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period_ even as in a drought a river will flow_ whose source is in the well_springs of far_off and undiscernible hills_ even now_ when the boats pulled upon this whale_ and perilously drew over his swaying flukes_ and the lances were darted into him_ they were followed by steady jets from the new made wound_ which kept continually playing_ while the natural spout_hole in his head was only at intervals_ however rapid_ sending its affrighted moisture into the air_ from this last vent no blood yet came_ because no vital part of him had thus far been struck_ his life_ as they significantly call it_ was untouched_ as the boats now more closely surrounded him_ the whole upper part of his form_ with much of it that is ordinarily submerged_ was plainly revealed_ his eyes_ or rather the places where his eyes had been_ were beheld_ as strange misgrown masses gather in the knot_holes of the noblest oaks when prostrate_ so from the points which the whale_s eyes had once occupied_ now protruded blind bulbs_ horribly pitiable to see_ but pity there was none_ for all his old age_ and his one arm_ and his blind eyes_ he must die the death and be murdered_ in order to light the gay bridals and other merry_makings of men_ and also to illuminate the solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all_ still rolling in his blood_ at last he partially disclosed a strangely discoloured bunch or protuberance_ the size of a bushel_ low down on the flank_ _a nice spot__ cried flask_ _just let me prick him there once__ _avast__ cried starbuck_ _there_s no need of that__ but humane starbuck was too late_ at the instant of the dart an ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound_ and goaded by it into more than sufferable anguish_ the whale now spouting thick blood_ with swift fury blindly darted at the craft_ bespattering them and their glorying crews all over with showers of gore_ capsizing flask_s boat and marring the bows_ it was his death stroke_ for_ by this time_ so spent was he by loss of blood_ that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had made_ lay panting on his side_ impotently flapped with his stumped fin_ then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world_ turned up the white secrets of his belly_ lay like a log_ and died_ it was most piteous_ that last expiring spout_ as when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain_ and with half_stifled melancholy gurglings the spray_column lowers and lowers to the ground_so the last long dying spout of the whale_ soon_ while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship_ the body showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled_ immediately_ by starbuck_s orders_ lines were secured to it at different points_ so that ere long every boat was a buoy_ the sunken whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords_ by very heedful management_ when the ship drew nigh_ the whale was transferred to her side_ and was strongly secured there by the stiffest fluke_chains_ for it was plain that unless artificially upheld_ the body would at once sink to the bottom_ it so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade_ the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh_ on the lower part of the bunch before described_ but as the stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales_ with the flesh perfectly healed around them_ and no prominence of any kind to denote their place_ therefore_ there must needs have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for the ulceration alluded to_ but still more curious was the fact of a lance_head of stone being found in him_ not far from the buried iron_ the flesh perfectly firm about it_ who had darted that stone lance_ and when_ it might have been darted by some nor_ west indian long before america was discovered_ what other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous cabinet there is no telling_ but a sudden stop was put to further discoveries_ by the ship_s being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways to the sea_ owing to the body_s immensely increasing tendency to sink_ however_ starbuck_ who had the ordering of affairs_ hung on to it to the last_ hung on to it so resolutely_ indeed_ that when at length the ship would have been capsized_ if still persisting in locking arms with the body_ then_ when the command was given to break clear from it_ such was the immovable strain upon the timber_heads to which the fluke_chains and cables were fastened_ that it was impossible to cast them off_ meantime everything in the pequod was aslant_ to cross to the other side of the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house_ the ship groaned and gasped_ many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and cabins were started from their places_ by the unnatural dislocation_ in vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the immovable fluke_chains_ to pry them adrift from the timberheads_ and so low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at all approached_ while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk_ and the ship seemed on the point of going over_ _hold on_ hold on_ won_t ye__ cried stubb to the body_ _don_t be in such a devil of a hurry to sink_ by thunder_ men_ we must do something or go for it_ no use prying there_ avast_ i say with your handspikes_ and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen_knife_ and cut the big chains__ _knife_ aye_ aye__ cried queequeg_ and seizing the carpenter_s heavy hatchet_ he leaned out of a porthole_ and steel to iron_ began slashing at the largest fluke_chains_ but a few strokes_ full of sparks_ were given_ when the exceeding strain effected the rest_ with a terrific snap_ every fastening went adrift_ the ship righted_ the carcase sank_ now_ this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed sperm whale is a very curious thing_ nor has any fisherman yet adequately accounted for it_ usually the dead sperm whale floats with great buoyancy_ with its side or belly considerably elevated above the surface_ if the only whales that thus sank were old_ meagre_ and broken_hearted creatures_ their pads of lard diminished and all their bones heavy and rheumatic_ then you might with some reason assert that this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so sinking_ consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him_ but it is not so_ for young whales_ in the highest health_ and swelling with noble aspirations_ prematurely cut off in the warm flush and may of life_ with all their panting lard about them_ even these brawny_ buoyant heroes do sometimes sink_ be it said_ however_ that the sperm whale is far less liable to this accident than any other species_ where one of that sort go down_ twenty right whales do_ this difference in the species is no doubt imputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the right whale_ his venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton_ from this incumbrance the sperm whale is wholly free_ but there are instances where_ after the lapse of many hours or several days_ the sunken whale again rises_ more buoyant than in life_ but the reason of this is obvious_ gases are generated in him_ he swells to a prodigious magnitude_ becomes a sort of animal balloon_ a line_of_battle ship could hardly keep him under then_ in the shore whaling_ on soundings_ among the bays of new zealand_ when a right whale gives token of sinking_ they fasten buoys to him_ with plenty of rope_ so that when the body has gone down_ they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again_ it was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from the pequod_s mast_heads_ announcing that the jungfrau was again lowering her boats_ though the only spout in sight was that of a fin_back_ belonging to the species of uncapturable whales_ because of its incredible power of swimming_ nevertheless_ the fin_back_s spout is so similar to the sperm whale_s_ that by unskilful fishermen it is often mistaken for it_ and consequently derick and all his host were now in valiant chase of this unnearable brute_ the virgin crowding all sail_ made after her four young keels_ and thus they all disappeared far to leeward_ still in bold_ hopeful chase_ oh_ many are the fin_backs_ and many are the dericks_ my friend_ chapter ___ the honour and glory of whaling_ there are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the true method_ the more i dive into this matter of whaling_ and push my researches up to the very spring_head of it so much the more am i impressed with its great honourableness and antiquity_ and especially when i find so many great demi_gods and heroes_ prophets of all sorts_ who one way or other have shed distinction upon it_ i am transported with the reflection that i myself belong_ though but subordinately_ to so emblazoned a fraternity_ the gallant perseus_ a son of jupiter_ was the first whaleman_ and to the eternal honour of our calling be it said_ that the first whale attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent_ those were the knightly days of our profession_ when we only bore arms to succor the distressed_ and not to fill men_s lamp_feeders_ every one knows the fine story of perseus and andromeda_ how the lovely andromeda_ the daughter of a king_ was tied to a rock on the sea_coast_ and as leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off_ perseus_ the prince of whalemen_ intrepidly advancing_ harpooned the monster_ and delivered and married the maid_ it was an admirable artistic exploit_ rarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day_ inasmuch as this leviathan was slain at the very first dart_ and let no man doubt this arkite story_ for in the ancient joppa_ now jaffa_ on the syrian coast_ in one of the pagan temples_ there stood for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale_ which the city_s legends and all the inhabitants asserted to be the identical bones of the monster that perseus slew_ when the romans took joppa_ the same skeleton was carried to italy in triumph_ what seems most singular and suggestively important in this story_ is this_ it was from joppa that jonah set sail_ akin to the adventure of perseus and andromeda_indeed_ by some supposed to be indirectly derived from it_is that famous story of st_ george and the dragon_ which dragon i maintain to have been a whale_ for in many old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled together_ and often stand for each other_ _thou art as a lion of the waters_ and as a dragon of the sea__ saith ezekiel_ hereby_ plainly meaning a whale_ in truth_ some versions of the bible use that word itself_ besides_ it would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had st_ george but encountered a crawling reptile of the land_ instead of doing battle with the great monster of the deep_ any man may kill a snake_ but only a perseus_ a st_ george_ a coffin_ have the heart in them to march boldly up to a whale_ let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us_ for though the creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely represented of a griffin_like shape_ and though the battle is depicted on land and the saint on horseback_ yet considering the great ignorance of those times_ when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists_ and considering that as in perseus_ case_ st_ george_s whale might have crawled up out of the sea on the beach_ and considering that the animal ridden by st_ george might have been only a large seal_ or sea_horse_ bearing all this in mind_ it will not appear altogether incompatible with the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene_ to hold this so_called dragon no other than the great leviathan himself_ in fact_ placed before the strict and piercing truth_ this whole story will fare like that fish_ flesh_ and fowl idol of the philistines_ dagon by name_ who being planted before the ark of israel_ his horse_s head and both the palms of his hands fell off from him_ and only the stump or fishy part of him remained_ thus_ then_ one of our own noble stamp_ even a whaleman_ is the tutelary guardian of england_ and by good rights_ we harpooneers of nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order of st_ george_ and therefore_ let not the knights of that honourable company _none of whom_ i venture to say_ have ever had to do with a whale like their great patron__ let them never eye a nantucketer with disdain_ since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we are much better entitled to st_ george_s decoration than they_ whether to admit hercules among us or not_ concerning this i long remained dubious_ for though according to the greek mythologies_ that antique crockett and kit carson_that brawny doer of rejoicing good deeds_ was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale_ still_ whether that strictly makes a whaleman of him_ that might be mooted_ it nowhere appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish_ unless_ indeed_ from the inside_ nevertheless_ he may be deemed a sort of involuntary whaleman_ at any rate the whale caught him_ if he did not the whale_ i claim him for one of our clan_ but_ by the best contradictory authorities_ this grecian story of hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more ancient hebrew story of jonah and the whale_ and vice versa_ certainly they are very similar_ if i claim the demigod then_ why not the prophet_ nor do heroes_ saints_ demigods_ and prophets alone comprise the whole roll of our order_ our grand master is still to be named_ for like royal kings of old times_ we find the head waters of our fraternity in nothing short of the great gods themselves_ that wondrous oriental story is now to be rehearsed from the shaster_ which gives us the dread vishnoo_ one of the three persons in the godhead of the hindoos_ gives us this divine vishnoo himself for our lord__vishnoo_ who_ by the first of his ten earthly incarnations_ has for ever set apart and sanctified the whale_ when brahma_ or the god of gods_ saith the shaster_ resolved to recreate the world after one of its periodical dissolutions_ he gave birth to vishnoo_ to preside over the work_ but the vedas_ or mystical books_ whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to vishnoo before beginning the creation_ and which therefore must have contained something in the shape of practical hints to young architects_ these vedas were lying at the bottom of the waters_ so vishnoo became incarnate in a whale_ and sounding down in him to the uttermost depths_ rescued the sacred volumes_ was not this vishnoo a whaleman_ then_ even as a man who rides a horse is called a horseman_ perseus_ st_ george_ hercules_ jonah_ and vishnoo_ there_s a member_roll for you_ what club but the whaleman_s can head off like that_ chapter ___ jonah historically regarded_ reference was made to the historical story of jonah and the whale in the preceding chapter_ now some nantucketers rather distrust this historical story of jonah and the whale_ but then there were some sceptical greeks and romans_ who_ standing out from the orthodox pagans of their times_ equally doubted the story of hercules and the whale_ and arion and the dolphin_ and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those traditions one whit the less facts_ for all that_ one old sag_harbor whaleman_s chief reason for questioning the hebrew story was this__he had one of those quaint old_fashioned bibles_ embellished with curious_ unscientific plates_ one of which represented jonah_s whale with two spouts in his head_a peculiarity only true with respect to a species of the leviathan _the right whale_ and the varieties of that order__ concerning which the fishermen have this saying_ _a penny roll would choke him__ his swallow is so very small_ but_ to this_ bishop jebb_s anticipative answer is ready_ it is not necessary_ hints the bishop_ that we consider jonah as tombed in the whale_s belly_ but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth_ and this seems reasonable enough in the good bishop_ for truly_ the right whale_s mouth would accommodate a couple of whist_tables_ and comfortably seat all the players_ possibly_ too_ jonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow tooth_ but_ on second thoughts_ the right whale is toothless_ another reason which sag_harbor _he went by that name_ urged for his want of faith in this matter of the prophet_ was something obscurely in reference to his incarcerated body and the whale_s gastric juices_ but this objection likewise falls to the ground_ because a german exegetist supposes that jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a dead whale_even as the french soldiers in the russian campaign turned their dead horses into tents_ and crawled into them_ besides_ it has been divined by other continental commentators_ that when jonah was thrown overboard from the joppa ship_ he straightway effected his escape to another vessel near by_ some vessel with a whale for a figure_head_ and_ i would add_ possibly called _the whale__ as some craft are nowadays christened the _shark__ the _gull__ the _eagle__ nor have there been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the whale mentioned in the book of jonah merely meant a life_preserver_an inflated bag of wind_which the endangered prophet swam to_ and so was saved from a watery doom_ poor sag_harbor_ therefore_ seems worsted all round_ but he had still another reason for his want of faith_ it was this_ if i remember right_ jonah was swallowed by the whale in the mediterranean sea_ and after three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days_ journey of nineveh_ a city on the tigris_ very much more than three days_ journey across from the nearest point of the mediterranean coast_ how is that_ but was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that short distance of nineveh_ yes_ he might have carried him round by the way of the cape of good hope_ but not to speak of the passage through the whole length of the mediterranean_ and another passage up the persian gulf and red sea_ such a supposition would involve the complete circumnavigation of all africa in three days_ not to speak of the tigris waters_ near the site of nineveh_ being too shallow for any whale to swim in_ besides_ this idea of jonah_s weathering the cape of good hope at so early a day would wrest the honour of the discovery of that great headland from bartholomew diaz_ its reputed discoverer_ and so make modern history a liar_ but all these foolish arguments of old sag_harbor only evinced his foolish pride of reason_a thing still more reprehensible in him_ seeing that he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the sun and the sea_ i say it only shows his foolish_ impious pride_ and abominable_ devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy_ for by a portuguese catholic priest_ this very idea of jonah_s going to nineveh via the cape of good hope was advanced as a signal magnification of the general miracle_ and so it was_ besides_ to this day_ the highly enlightened turks devoutly believe in the historical story of jonah_ and some three centuries ago_ an english traveller in old harris_s voyages_ speaks of a turkish mosque built in honour of jonah_ in which mosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil_ chapter ___ pitchpoling_ to make them run easily and swiftly_ the axles of carriages are anointed_ and for much the same purpose_ some whalers perform an analogous operation upon their boat_ they grease the bottom_ nor is it to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm_ it may possibly be of no contemptible advantage_ considering that oil and water are hostile_ that oil is a sliding thing_ and that the object in view is to make the boat slide bravely_ queequeg believed strongly in anointing his boat_ and one morning not long after the german ship jungfrau disappeared_ took more than customary pains in that occupation_ crawling under its bottom_ where it hung over the side_ and rubbing in the unctuousness as though diligently

raised_ but so soon as the ship sailed down to them_ they turned and fled with swift precipitancy_ a disordered flight_ as of cleopatra_s barges from actium_ nevertheless_ the boats pursued_ and stubb_s was foremost_ by great exertion_ tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron_ but the stricken whale_ without at all sounding_ still continued his horizontal flight_ with added fleetness_ such unintermitted strainings upon the planted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it_ it became imperative to lance the flying whale_ or be content to lose him_ but to haul the boat up to his flank was impossible_ he swam so fast and furious_ what then remained_ of all the wondrous devices and dexterities_ the sleights of hand and countless subtleties_ to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced_ none exceed that fine manoeuvre with the lance called pitchpoling_ small sword_ or broad sword_ in all its exercises boasts nothing like it_ it is only indispensable with an inveterate running whale_ its grand fact and feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is accurately darted from a violently rocking_ jerking boat_ under extreme headway_ steel and wood included_ the entire spear is some ten or twelve feet in length_ the staff is much slighter than that of the harpoon_ and also of a lighter material_pine_ it is furnished with a small rope called a warp_ of considerable length_ by which it can be hauled back to the hand after darting_ but before going further_ it is important to mention here_ that though the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance_ yet it is seldom done_ and when done_ is still less frequently successful_ on account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as compared with the lance_ which in effect become serious drawbacks_ as a general thing_ therefore_ you must first get fast to a whale_ before any pitchpoling comes into play_ look now at stubb_ a man who from his humorous_ deliberate coolness and equanimity in the direst emergencies_ was specially qualified to excel in pitchpoling_ look at him_ he stands upright in the tossed bow of the flying boat_ wrapt in fleecy foam_ the towing whale is forty feet ahead_ handling the long lance lightly_ glancing twice or thrice along its length to see if it be exactly straight_ stubb whistlingly gathers up the coil of the warp in one hand_ so as to secure its free end in his grasp_ leaving the rest unobstructed_ then holding the lance full before his waistband_s middle_ he levels it at the whale_ when_ covering him with it_ he steadily depresses the butt_end in his hand_ thereby elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon his palm_ fifteen feet in the air_ he minds you somewhat of a juggler_

that for six thousand years_and no one knows how many millions of ages before_the great whales should have been spouting all over the sea_ and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep_ as with so many sprinkling or mistifying pots_ and that for some centuries back_ thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the whale_ watching these sprinklings and spoutings_that all this should be_ and yet_ that down to this blessed minute _fifteen and a quarter minutes past one o_clock p_m_ of this sixteenth day of december_ a_d_ ______ it should still remain a problem_ whether these spoutings are_ after all_ really water_ or nothing but vapour_this is surely a noteworthy thing_ let us_ then_ look at this matter_ along with some interesting items contingent_ every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their gills_ the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is combined with the element in which they swim_ hence_ a herring or a cod might live a century_ and never once raise its head above the surface_ but owing to his marked internal structure which gives him regular lungs_ like a human being_s_ the whale can only live by inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere_ wherefore the necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world_ but he cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth_ for_ in his ordinary attitude_ the sperm whale_s mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the surface_ and what is still more_ his windpipe has no connexion with his mouth_ no_ he breathes through his spiracle alone_ and this is on the top of his head_ if i say_ that in any creature breathing is only a function indispensable to vitality_ inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a certain element_ which being subsequently brought into contact with the blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle_ i do not think i shall err_ though i may possibly use some superfluous scientific words_ assume it_ and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be aerated with one breath_ he might then seal up his nostrils and not fetch another for a considerable time_ that is to say_ he would then live without breathing_ anomalous as it may seem_ this is precisely the case with the whale_ who systematically lives_ by intervals_ his full hour and more _when at the bottom_ without drawing a single breath_ or so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air_ for_ remember_ he has no gills_ how is this_ between his ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable involved cretan labyrinth of vermicelli_like vessels_ which vessels_ when he quits the surface_ are completely distended with oxygenated blood_ so that for an hour or more_ a thousand fathoms in the sea_ he carries a surplus stock of vitality in him_ just as the camel crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four supplementary stomachs_ the anatomical fact of this labyrinth is indisputable_ and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable and true_ seems the more cogent to me_ when i consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in having his spoutings out_ as the fishermen phrase it_ this is what i mean_ if unmolested_ upon rising to the surface_ the sperm whale will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings_ say he stays eleven minutes_ and jets seventy times_ that is_ respires seventy breaths_ then whenever he rises again_ he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again_ to a minute_ now_ if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him_ so that he sounds_ he will be always dodging up again to make good his regular allowance of air_ and not till those seventy breaths are told_ will he finally go down to stay out his full term below_ remark_ however_ that in different individuals these rates are different_ but in any one they are alike_ now_ why should the whale thus insist upon having his spoutings out_ unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air_ ere descending for good_ how obvious is it_ too_ that this necessity for the whale_s rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase_ for not by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught_ when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight_ not so much thy skill_ then_ o hunter_ as the great necessities that strike the victory to thee_ in man_ breathing is incessantly going on_one breath only serving for two or three pulsations_ so that whatever other business he has to attend to_ waking or sleeping_ breathe he must_ or die he will_ but the sperm whale only breathes about one seventh or sunday of his time_ it has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout_hole_ if it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water_ then i opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems obliterated in him_ for the only thing about him that at all answers to his nose is that identical spout_hole_ and being so clogged with two elements_ it could not be expected to have the power of smelling_ but owing to the mystery of the spout_whether it be water or whether it be vapour_no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on this head_ sure it is_ nevertheless_ that the sperm whale has no proper olfactories_ but what does he want of them_ no roses_ no violets_ no cologne_water in the sea_ furthermore_ as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting canal_ and as that long canal_like the grand erie canal_is furnished with a sort of locks _that open and shut_ for the downward retention of air or the upward exclusion of water_ therefore the whale has no voice_ unless you insult him by saying_ that when he so strangely rumbles_ he talks through his nose_ but then again_ what has the whale to say_ seldom have i known any profound being that had anything to say to this world_ unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a living_ oh_ happy that the world is such an excellent listener_ now_ the spouting canal of the sperm whale_ chiefly intended as it is for the conveyance of air_ and for several feet laid along_ horizontally_ just beneath the upper surface of his head_ and a little to one side_ this curious canal is very much like a gas_pipe laid down in a city on one side of a street_ but the question returns whether this gas_pipe is also a water_pipe_ in other words_ whether the spout of the sperm whale is the mere vapour of the exhaled breath_ or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth_ and discharged through the spiracle_ it is certain that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal_ but it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the spiracle_ because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be_ when in feeding he accidentally takes in water_ but the sperm whale_s food is far beneath the surface_ and there he cannot spout even if he would_ besides_ if you regard him very closely_ and time him with your watch_ you will find that when unmolested_ there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration_ but why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject_ speak out_ you have seen him spout_ then declare what the spout is_ can you not tell water from air_ my dear sir_ in this world it is not so easy to settle these plain things_ i have ever found your plain things the knottiest of all_ and as for this whale spout_ you might almost stand in it_ and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely_ the central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping it_ and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it_ when_ always_ when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his spout_ he is in a prodigious commotion_ the water cascading all around him_ and if at such times you should think that you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout_ how do you know that they are not merely condensed from its vapour_ or how do you know that they are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the spout_hole fissure_ which is countersunk into the summit of the whale_s head_ for even when tranquilly swimming through the mid_day sea in a calm_ with his elevated hump sun_dried as a dromedary_s in the desert_ even then_ the whale always carries a small basin of water on his head_ as under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with rain_ nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the precise nature of the whale spout_ it will not do for him to be peering into it_ and putting his face in it_ you cannot go with your pitcher to this fountain and fill it_ and bring it away_ for even when coming into slight contact with the outer_ vapoury shreds of the jet_ which will often happen_ your skin will feverishly smart_ from the acridness of the thing so touching it_ and i know one_ who coming into still closer contact with the spout_ whether with some scientific object in view_ or otherwise_ i cannot say_ the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm_ wherefore_ among whalemen_ the spout is deemed poisonous_ they try to evade it_ another thing_ i have heard it said_ and i do not much doubt it_ that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes_ it will blind you_ the wisest thing the investigator can do then_ it seems to me_ is to let this deadly spout alone_ still_ we can hypothesize_ even if we cannot prove and establish_ my hypothesis is this_ that the spout is nothing but mist_ and besides other reasons_ to this conclusion i am impelled_ by considerations touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the sperm whale_ i account him no common_ shallow being_ inasmuch as it is an undisputed fact that he is never found on soundings_ or near shores_ all other whales sometimes are_ he is both ponderous and profound_ and i am convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings_ such as plato_ pyrrho_ the devil_ jupiter_ dante_ and so on_ there always goes up a certain semi_visible steam_ while in the act of thinking deep thoughts_ while composing a little treatise on eternity_ i had the curiosity to place a mirror before me_ and ere long saw reflected there_ a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over my head_ the invariable moisture of my hair_ while plunged in deep thought_ after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic_ of an august noon_ this seems an additional argument for the above supposition_ and how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty_ misty monster_ to behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea_ his vast_ mild head overhung by a canopy of vapour_ engendered by his incommunicable contemplations_ and that vapour_as you will sometimes see it_glorified by a rainbow_ as if heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts_ for_ d_ye see_ rainbows do not visit the clear air_ they only irradiate vapour_ and so_ through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my mind_ divine intuitions now and then shoot_ enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray_ and for this i thank god_ for all have doubts_ many deny_ but doubts or denials_ few along with them_ have intuitions_ doubts of all things earthly_ and intuitions of some things heavenly_ this combination makes neither believer nor infidel_ but makes a man who regards them both with equal eye_ chapter ___ the tail_ other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope_ and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights_ less celestial_ i celebrate a tail_ reckoning the largest sized sperm whale_s tail to begin at that point of the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man_ it comprises upon its upper surface alone_ an area of at least fifty square feet_ the compact round body of its root expands into two broad_ firm_ flat palms or flukes_ gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in thickness_ at the crotch or junction_ these flukes slightly overlap_ then sideways recede from each other like wings_ leaving a wide vacancy between_ in no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely defined than in the crescentic borders of these flukes_ at its utmost expansion in the full grown whale_ the tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across_ the entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews_ but cut into it_ and you find that three distinct strata compose it__upper_ middle_ and lower_ the fibres in the upper and lower layers_ are long and horizontal_ those of the middle one_ very short_ and running crosswise between the outside layers_ this triune structure_ as much as anything else_ imparts power to the tail_ to the student of old roman walls_ the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful relics of the antique_ and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the great strength of the masonry_ but as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough_ the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of muscular fibres and filaments_ which passing on either side the loins and running down into the flukes_ insensibly blend with them_ and largely contribute to their might_ so that in the tail the confluent measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point_ could annihilation occur to matter_ this were the thing to do it_ nor does this_its amazing strength_ at all tend to cripple the graceful flexion of its motions_ where infantileness of ease undulates through a titanism of power_ on the contrary_ those motions derive their most appalling beauty from it_ real strength never impairs beauty or harmony_ but it often bestows it_ and in everything imposingly beautiful_ strength has much to do with the magic_ take away the tied tendons that all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved hercules_ and its charm would be gone_ as devout eckerman lifted the linen sheet from the naked corpse of goethe_ he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the man_ that seemed as a roman triumphal arch_ when angelo paints even god the father in human form_ mark what robustness is there_ and whatever they may reveal of the divine love in the son_ the soft_ curled_ hermaphroditical italian pictures_ in which his idea has been most successfully embodied_ these pictures_ so destitute as they are of all brawniness_ hint nothing of any power_ but the mere negative_ feminine one of submission and endurance_ which on all hands it is conceded_ form the peculiar practical virtues of his teachings_ such is the subtle elasticity of the organ i treat of_ that whether wielded in sport_ or in earnest_ or in anger_ whatever be the mood it be in_ its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace_ therein no fairy_s arm can transcend it_ five great motions are peculiar to it_ first_ when used as a fin for progression_ second_ when used as a mace in battle_ third_ in sweeping_ fourth_ in lobtailing_ fifth_ in peaking flukes_ first_ being horizontal in its position_ the leviathan_s tail acts in a different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures_ it never wriggles_ in man or fish_ wriggling is a sign of inferiority_ to the whale_ his tail is the sole means of propulsion_ scroll_wise coiled forwards beneath the body_ and then rapidly sprung backwards_ it is this which gives that singular darting_ leaping motion to the monster when furiously swimming_ his side_fins only serve to steer by_ second_ it is a little significant_ that while one sperm whale only fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw_ nevertheless_ in his conflicts with man_ he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail_ in striking at a boat_ he swiftly curves away his flukes from it_ and the blow is only inflicted by the recoil_ if it be made in the unobstructed air_ especially if it descend to its mark_ the stroke is then simply irresistible_ no ribs of man or boat can withstand it_ your only salvation lies in eluding it_ but if it comes sideways through the opposing water_ then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the whale boat_ and the elasticity of its materials_ a cracked rib or a dashed plank or two_ a sort of stitch in the side_ is generally the most serious result_ these submerged side blows are so often received in the fishery_ that they are accounted mere child_s play_ some one strips off a frock_ and the hole is stopped_ third_ i cannot demonstrate it_ but it seems to me_ that in the whale the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail_ for in this respect there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the elephant_s trunk_ this delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of sweeping_ when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of the sea_ and if he feel but a sailor_s whisker_ woe to that sailor_ whiskers and all_ what tenderness there is in that preliminary touch_ had this tail any prehensile power_ i should straightway bethink me of darmonodes_ elephant that so frequented the flower_market_ and with low salutations presented nosegays to damsels_ and then caressed their zones_ on more accounts than one_ a pity it is that the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue in his tail_ for i have heard of yet another elephant_ that when wounded in the fight_ curved round his trunk and extracted the dart_ fourth_ stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the middle of solitary seas_ you find him unbent from the vast corpulence of his dignity_ and kitten_like_ he plays on the ocean as if it were a hearth_ but still you see his power in his play_ the broad palms of his tail are flirted high into the air_ then smiting the surface_ the thunderous concussion resounds for miles_ you would almost think a great gun had been discharged_ and if you noticed the light wreath of vapour from the spiracle at his other extremity_ you would think that that was the smoke from the touch_hole_ fifth_ as in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes lie considerably below the level of his back_ they are then completely out of sight beneath the surface_ but when he is about to plunge into the deeps_ his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are tossed erect in the air_ and so remain vibrating a moment_ till they downwards shoot out of view_ excepting the sublime breach_somewhere else to be described_this peaking of the whale_s flukes is perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature_ out of the bottomless profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the highest heaven_ so in dreams_ have i seen majestic satan thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw from the flame baltic of hell_ but in gazing at such scenes_ it is all in all what mood you are in_ if in the dantean_ the devils will occur to you_ if in that of isaiah_ the archangels_ standing at the mast_head of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky and sea_ i once saw a large herd of whales in the east_ all heading towards the sun_ and for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked flukes_ as it seemed to me at the time_ such a grand embodiment of adoration of the gods was never beheld_ even in persia_ the home of the fire worshippers_ as ptolemy philopater testified of the african elephant_ i then testified of the whale_ pronouncing him the most devout of all beings_ for according to king juba_ the military elephants of antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the profoundest silence_ the chance comparison in this chapter_ between the whale and the elephant_ so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk of the other are concerned_ should not tend to place those two opposite organs on an equality_ much less the creatures to which they respectively belong_ for as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to leviathan_ so_ compared with leviathan_s tail_ his trunk is but the stalk of a lily_ the most direful blow from the elephant_s trunk were as the playful tap of a fan_ compared with the measureless crush and crash of the sperm whale_s ponderous flukes_ which in repeated instances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all their oars and crews into the air_ very much as an indian juggler tosses his balls__ _though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale and the elephant is preposterous_ inasmuch as in that particular the elephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does to the elephant_ nevertheless_ there are not wanting some points of curious similitude_ among these is the spout_ it is well known that the elephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk_ and then elevating it_ jet it forth in a stream_ the more i consider this mighty tail_ the more do i deplore my inability to express it_ at times there are gestures in it_ which_ though they would well grace the hand of man_ remain wholly inexplicable_ in an extensive herd_ so remarkable_ occasionally_ are these mystic gestures_ that i have heard hunters who have declared them akin to free_mason signs and symbols_ that the whale_ indeed_ by these methods intelligently conversed with the world_ nor are there wanting other motions of the whale in his general body_ full of strangeness_ and unaccountable to his most experienced assailant_ dissect him how i may_ then_ i but go skin deep_ i know him not_ and never will_ but if i know not even the tail of this whale_ how understand his head_ much more_ how

will about his face_ i say again he has no face_ chapter ___ the grand armada_ the long and narrow peninsula of malacca_ extending south_eastward from the territories of birmah_ forms the most southerly point of all asia_ in a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of sumatra_ java_ bally_ and timor_ which_ with many others_ form a vast mole_ or rampart_ lengthwise connecting asia with australia_ and dividing the long unbroken indian ocean from the thickly studded oriental archipelagoes_ this rampart is pierced by several sally_ports for the convenience of ships and whales_ conspicuous among which are the straits of sunda and malacca_ by the straits of sunda_ chiefly_ vessels bound to china from the west_ emerge into the china seas_ those narrow straits of sunda divide sumatra from java_ and standing midway in that vast rampart of islands_ buttressed by that bold green promontory_ known to seamen as java head_ they not a little correspond to the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire_ and considering the inexhaustible wealth of spices_ and silks_ and jewels_ and gold_ and ivory_ with which the thousand islands of that oriental sea are enriched_ it seems a significant provision of nature_ that such treasures_ by the very formation of the land_ should at least bear the appearance_ however ineffectual_ of being guarded from the all_grasping western world_ the shores of the straits of sunda are unsupplied with those domineering fortresses which guard the entrances to the mediterranean_ the baltic_ and the propontis_ unlike the danes_ these orientals do not demand the obsequious homage of lowered top_sails from the endless procession of ships before the wind_ which for centuries past_ by night and by day_ have passed between the islands of sumatra and java_ freighted with the costliest cargoes of the east_ but while they freely waive a ceremonial like this_ they do by no means renounce their claim to more solid tribute_ time out of mind the piratical proas of the malays_ lurking among the low shaded coves and islets of sumatra_ have sallied out upon the vessels sailing through the straits_ fiercely demanding tribute at the point of their spears_ though by the repeated bloody chastisements they have received at the hands of european cruisers_ the audacity of these corsairs has of late been somewhat repressed_ yet_ even at the present day_ we occasionally hear of english and american vessels_ which_ in those waters_ have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged_ with a fair_ fresh wind_ the pequod was now drawing nigh to these straits_ ahab purposing to pass through them into the javan sea_ and thence_ cruising northwards_ over waters known to be frequented here and there by the sperm whale_ sweep inshore by the philippine islands_ and gain the far coast of japan_ in time for the great whaling season there_ by these means_ the circumnavigating pequod would sweep almost all the known sperm whale cruising grounds of the world_ previous to descending upon the line in the pacific_ where ahab_ though everywhere else foiled in his pursuit_ firmly counted upon giving battle to moby dick_ in the sea he was most known to frequent_ and at a season when he might most reasonably be presumed to be haunting it_ but how now_ in this zoned quest_ does ahab touch no land_ does his crew drink air_ surely_ he will stop for water_ nay_ for a long time_ now_ the circus_running sun has raced within his fiery ring_ and needs no sustenance but what_s in himself_ so ahab_ mark this_ too_ in the whaler_ while other hulls are loaded down with alien stuff_ to be transferred to foreign wharves_ the world_wandering whale_ship carries no cargo but herself and crew_ their weapons and their wants_

nantucket water_ which_ when three years afloat_ the nantucketer_ in the pacific_ prefers to drink before the brackish fluid_ but yesterday rafted off in casks_ from the peruvian or indian streams_ hence it is_ that_ while other ships may have gone to china from new york_ and back again_ touching at a score of ports_ the whale_ship_ in all that interval_ may not have sighted one grain of soil_ her crew having seen no man but floating seamen like themselves_ so that did you carry them the news that another flood had come_ they would only answer__well_ boys_ here_s the ark__ now_ as many sperm whales had been captured off the western coast of java_ in the near vicinity of the straits of sunda_ indeed_ as most of the ground_ roundabout_ was generally recognised by the fishermen as an excellent spot for cruising_ therefore_ as the pequod gained more and more upon java head_ the look_outs were repeatedly hailed_ and admonished to keep wide awake_ but though the green palmy cliffs of the land soon loomed on the starboard bow_ and with delighted nostrils the fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air_ yet not a single jet was descried_ almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game hereabouts_ the ship had well nigh entered the straits_ when the customary cheering cry was heard from aloft_ and ere long a spectacle of singular magnificence saluted us_ but here be it premised_ that owing to the unwearied activity with which of late they have been hunted over all four oceans_ the sperm whales_ instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached companies_ as in former times_ are now frequently met with in extensive herds_ sometimes embracing so great a multitude_ that it would almost seem as if numerous nations of them had sworn solemn league and covenant for mutual assistance and protection_ to this aggregation of the sperm whale into such immense caravans_ may be imputed the circumstance that even in the best cruising grounds_ you may now sometimes sail for weeks and months together_ without being greeted by a single spout_ and then be suddenly saluted by what sometimes seems thousands on thousands_ broad on both bows_ at the distance of some two or three miles_ and forming a great semicircle_ embracing one half of the level horizon_ a continuous chain of whale_jets were up_playing and sparkling in the noon_day air_ unlike the straight perpendicular twin_jets of the right whale_ which_ dividing at top_ fall over in two branches_ like the cleft drooping boughs of a willow_ the single forward_slanting spout of the sperm whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist_ continually rising and falling away to leeward_ seen from the pequod_s deck_ then_ as she would rise on a high hill of the sea_ this host of vapoury spouts_ individually curling up into the air_ and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze_ showed like the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis_ descried of a balmy autumnal morning_ by some horseman on a height_ as marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains_ accelerate their march_ all eagerness to place that perilous passage in their rear_ and once more expand in comparative security upon the plain_ even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward through the straits_ gradually contracting the wings of their semicircle_ and swimming on_ in one solid_ but still crescentic centre_ crowding all sail the pequod pressed after them_ the harpooneers handling their weapons_ and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet suspended boats_ if the wind only held_ little doubt had they_ that chased through these straits of sunda_ the vast host would only deploy into the oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of their number_ and who could tell whether_ in that congregated caravan_ moby dick himself might not temporarily be swimming_ like the worshipped white_elephant in the coronation procession of the siamese_ so with stun_sail piled on stun_sail_ we sailed along_ driving these leviathans before us_ when_ of a sudden_ the voice of tashtego was heard_ loudly directing attention to something in our wake_ corresponding to the crescent in our van_ we beheld another in our rear_ it seemed formed of detached white vapours_ rising and falling something like the spouts of the whales_ only they did not so completely come and go_ for they constantly hovered_ without finally disappearing_ levelling his glass at this sight_ ahab quickly revolved in his pivot_hole_ crying_ _aloft there_ and rig whips and buckets to wet the sails__malays_ sir_ and after us__ as if too long lurking behind the headlands_ till the pequod should fairly have entered the straits_ these rascally asiatics were now in hot pursuit_ to make up for their over_cautious delay_ but when the swift pequod_ with a fresh leading wind_ was herself in hot chase_ how very kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on to her own chosen pursuit__mere riding_whips and rowels to her_ that they were_ as with glass under arm_ ahab to_and_fro paced the deck_ in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased_ and in the after one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing him_ some such fancy as the above seemed his_ and when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery defile in which the ship was then sailing_ and bethought him that through that gate lay the route to his vengeance_ and beheld_ how that through that same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his deadly end_ and not only that_ but a herd of remorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with their curses__when all these conceits had passed through his brain_ ahab_s brow was left gaunt and ribbed_ like the black sand beach after some stormy tide has been gnawing it_ without being able to drag the firm thing from its place_ but thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew_ and when_ after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern_ the pequod at last shot by the vivid green cockatoo point on the sumatra side_ emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond_ then_ the harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been gaining upon the ship_ than to rejoice that the ship had so victoriously gained upon the malays_ but still driving on in the wake of the whales_ at length they seemed abating their speed_ gradually the ship neared them_ and the wind now dying away_ word was passed to spring to the boats_ but no sooner did the herd_ by some presumed wonderful instinct of the sperm whale_ become notified of the three keels that were after them__though as yet a mile in their rear__than they rallied again_ and forming in close ranks and battalions_ so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked bayonets_ moved on with redoubled velocity_ stripped to our shirts and drawers_ we sprang to the white_ash_ and after several hours_ pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase_ when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating token that they were now at last under the influence of that strange perplexity of inert irresolution_ which_ when the fishermen perceive it in the whale_ they say he is gallied_ the compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming_ were now broken up in one measureless rout_ and like king porus_ elephants in the indian battle with alexander_ they seemed going mad with consternation_ in all directions expanding in vast irregular circles_ and aimlessly swimming hither and thither_ by their short thick spoutings_ they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic_ this was still more strangely evinced by those of their number_ who_ completely paralysed as it were_ helplessly floated like water_logged dismantled ships on the sea_ had these leviathans been but a flock of simple sheep_ pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves_ they could not possibly have evinced such excessive dismay_ but this occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures_ though banding together in tens of thousands_ the lion_maned buffaloes of the west have fled before a solitary horseman_ witness_ too_ all human beings_ how when herded together in the sheepfold of a theatre_s pit_ they will_ at the slightest alarm of fire_ rush helter_skelter for the outlets_ crowding_ trampling_ jamming_ and remorselessly dashing each other to death_ best_ therefore_ withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales before us_ for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men_ though many of the whales_ as has been said_ were in violent motion_ yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor retreated_ but collectively remained in one place_ as is customary in those cases_ the boats at once separated_ each making for some one lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal_ in about three minutes_ time_ queequeg_s harpoon was flung_ the stricken fish darted blinding spray in our faces_ and then running away with us like light_ steered straight for the heart of the herd_ though such a movement on the part of the whale struck under such circumstances_ is in no wise unprecedented_ and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated_ yet does it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery_ for as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal_ you bid adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb_ as_ blind and deaf_ the whale plunged forward_ as if by sheer power of speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him_ as we thus tore a white gash in the sea_ on all sides menaced as we flew_ by the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us_ our beset boat was like a ship mobbed by ice_isles in a tempest_ and striving to steer through their complicated channels and straits_ knowing not at what moment it may be locked in and crushed_ but not a bit daunted_ queequeg steered us manfully_ now sheering off from this monster directly across our route in advance_ now edging away from that_ whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead_ while all the time_ starbuck stood up in the bows_ lance in hand_ pricking out of our way whatever whales he could reach by short darts_ for there was no time to make long ones_ nor were the oarsmen quite idle_ though their wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with_ they chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business_ _out of the way_ commodore__ cried one_ to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface_ and for an instant threatened to swamp us_ _hard down with your tail_ there__ cried a second to another_ which_ close to our gunwale_ seemed calmly cooling himself with his own fan_like extremity_ all whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances_ originally invented by the nantucket indians_ called druggs_ two thick squares of wood of equal size are stoutly clenched together_ so that they cross each other_s grain at right angles_ a line of considerable length is then attached to the middle of this block_ and the other end of the line being looped_ it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon_ it is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used_ for then_ more whales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time_ but sperm whales are not every day encountered_ while you may_ then_ you must kill all you can_ and if you cannot kill them all at once_ you must wing them_ so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure_ hence it is_ that at times like these the drugg_ comes into requisition_ our boat was furnished with three of them_ the first and second were successfully darted_ and we saw the whales staggeringly running off_ fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing drugg_ they were cramped like malefactors with the chain and ball_ but upon flinging the third_ in the act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block_ it caught under one of the seats of the boat_ and in an instant tore it out and carried it away_ dropping the oarsman in the boat_s bottom as the seat slid from under him_ on both sides the sea came in at the wounded planks_ but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in_ and so stopped the leaks for the time_ it had been next to impossible to dart these drugged_harpoons_ were it not that as we advanced into the herd_ our whale_s way greatly diminished_ moreover_ that as we went still further and further from the circumference of commotion_ the direful disorders seemed waning_ so that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out_ and the towing whale sideways vanished_ then_ with the tapering force of his parting momentum_ we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the shoal_ as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake_ here the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost whales_ were heard but not felt_ in this central expanse the sea presented that smooth satin_like surface_ called a sleek_ produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods_ yes_ we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the heart of every commotion_ and still in the distracted distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles_ and saw successive pods of whales_ eight or ten in each_ swiftly going round and round_ like multiplied spans of horses in a ring_ and so closely shoulder to shoulder_ that a titanic circus_rider might easily have over_arched the middle ones_ and so have gone round on their backs_ owing to the density of the crowd of reposing whales_ more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd_ no possible chance of escape was at present afforded us_ we must watch for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in_ the wall that had only admitted us in order to shut us up_ keeping at the centre of the lake_ we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves_ the women and children of this routed host_ now_ inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving outer circles_ and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in any one of those circles_ the entire area at this juncture_ embraced by the whole multitude_ must have contained at least two or three square miles_ at any rate_though indeed such a test at such a time might be deceptive_spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon_ i mention this circumstance_ because_ as if the cows and calves had been purposely locked up in this innermost fold_ and as if the wide extent of the herd had hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its stopping_ or_ possibly_ being so young_ unsophisticated_ and every way innocent and inexperienced_ however it may have been_ these smaller whales_now and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the lake_evinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence_ or else a still becharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at_ like household dogs they came snuffling round us_ right up to our gunwales_ and touching them_ till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them_ queequeg patted their foreheads_ starbuck scratched their backs with his lance_ but fearful of the consequences_ for the time refrained from darting it_ but far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface_ another and still stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side_ for_ suspended in those watery vaults_ floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the whales_ and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become mothers_ the lake_ as i have hinted_ was to a considerable depth exceedingly transparent_ and as human infants while suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast_ as if leading two different lives at the time_ and while yet drawing mortal nourishment_ be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence__even so did the young of these whales seem looking up towards us_ but not at us_ as if we were but a bit of gulfweed in their new_born sight_ floating on their sides_ the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us_ one of these little infants_ that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old_ might have measured some fourteen feet in length_ and some six feet in girth_ he was a little frisky_ though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal reticule_ where_ tail to head_ and all ready for the final spring_ the unborn whale lies bent like a tartar_s bow_ the delicate side_fins_ and the palms of his flukes_ still freshly retained the plaited crumpled appearance of a baby_s ears newly arrived from foreign parts_ _line_ line__ cried queequeg_ looking over the gunwale_ _him fast_ him fast__who line him_ who struck__two whale_ one big_ one little__ _what ails ye_ man__ cried starbuck_ _look_e here__ said queequeg_ pointing down_ as when the stricken whale_ that from the tub has reeled out hundreds of fathoms of rope_ as_ after deep sounding_ he floats up again_ and shows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling towards the air_ so now_ starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord of madame leviathan_ by which the young cub seemed still tethered to its dam_ not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase_ this natural line_ with the maternal end loose_ becomes entangled with the hempen one_ so that the cub is thereby trapped_ some of the subtlest secrets of the seas seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond_ we saw young leviathan amours in the deep__ _the sperm whale_ as with all other species of the leviathan_ but unlike most other fish_ breeds indifferently at all seasons_ after a gestation which may probably be set down at nine months_ producing but one at a time_ though in some few known instances giving birth to an esau and jacob__a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats_ curiously situated_ one on each side of the anus_ but the breasts themselves extend upwards from that_ when by chance these precious parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter_s lance_ the mother_s pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rods_ the milk is very sweet and rich_ it has been tasted by man_ it might do well with strawberries_ when overflowing with mutual esteem_ the whales salute more hominum_ and thus_ though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations and affrights_ did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments_ yea_ serenely revelled in dalliance and delight_ but even so_ amid the tornadoed atlantic of my being_ do i myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm_ and while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me_ deep down and deep inland there i still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy_ meanwhile_ as we thus lay entranced_ the occasional sudden frantic spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats_ still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host_ or possibly carrying on the war within the first circle_ where abundance of room and some convenient retreats were afforded them_ but the sight of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro across the circles_ was nothing to what at last met our eyes_ it is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful and alert_ to seek to hamstring him_ as it were_ by sundering or maiming his gigantic tail_tendon_ it is done by darting a short_handled cutting_spade_ to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again_ a whale wounded _as we afterwards learned_ in this part_ but not effectually_ as it seemed_ had broken away from the boat_ carrying along with him half of the harpoon line_ and in the extraordinary agony of the wound_ he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado arnold_ at the battle of saratoga_ carrying dismay wherever he went_ but agonizing as was the wound of this whale_ and an appalling spectacle enough_ any way_ yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to inspire the rest of the herd_ was owing to a cause which at first the intervening distance obscured from us_ but at length we perceived that by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery_ this whale had become entangled in the harpoon_line that he towed_ he had also run away with the cutting_spade in him_ and while the free end of the rope attached to that weapon_ had permanently caught in the coils of the harpoon_line round his tail_ the cutting_spade itself had worked loose from his flesh_ so that tormented to madness_ he was now churning through the water_ violently flailing with his flexible tail_ and tossing the keen spade about him_ wounding and murdering his own comrades_ this terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their stationary fright_ first_ the whales forming the margin of our lake began to crowd a little_ and tumble against each other_ as if lifted by half spent billows from afar_ then the lake itself began faintly to heave and swell_ the submarine bridal_chambers and nurseries vanished_ in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more central circles began to swim in thickening clusters_ yes_ the long calm was departing_ a low advancing hum was soon heard_ and then like to the tumultuous masses of block_ice when the great river hudson breaks up in spring_ the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner centre_ as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain_ instantly starbuck and queequeg changed places_ starbuck taking the stern_ _oars_ oars__ he intensely whispered_ seizing the helm__gripe your oars_ and clutch your souls_ now_ my god_ men_ stand by_ shove him off_ you queequeg_the whale there__prick him__hit him_ stand up_stand up_ and stay so_ spring_ men_pull_ men_ never mind their backs_scrape them__scrape away__ the boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks_ leaving a narrow dardanelles between their long lengths_ but by desperate endeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening_ then giving way rapidly_ and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet_ after many similar hair_breadth escapes_ we at last swiftly glided into what had just been one of the outer circles_ but now crossed by random whales_ all violently making for one centre_ this lucky salvation was cheaply purchased by the loss of queequeg_s hat_ who_ while standing in the bows to prick the fugitive whales_ had his hat taken clean from his head by the air_eddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad flukes close by_ riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was_ it soon resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement_ for having clumped together at last in one dense body_ they then renewed their onward flight with augmented fleetness_ further pursuit was useless_ but the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged whales might be dropped astern_ and likewise to secure one which flask had killed and waifed_ the waif is a pennoned pole_ two or three of which are carried by every boat_ and which_ when additional game is at hand_ are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale_ both to mark its place on the sea_ and also as token of prior possession_ should the boats of any other ship draw near_ the result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious saying in the fishery__the more whales the less fish_ of all the drugged whales only one was captured_ the rest contrived to escape for the time_ but only to be taken_ as will hereafter be seen_ by some other craft than the pequod_ chapter ___ schools and schoolmasters_ the previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of sperm whales_ and there was also then given the probable cause inducing those vast aggregations_ now_ though such great bodies are at times encountered_ yet_ as must have been seen_ even at the present day_ small detached bands are occasionally observed_ embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each_ such bands are known as schools_ they generally are of two sorts_ those composed almost entirely of females_ and those mustering none but young vigorous males_ or bulls_ as they are familiarly designated_ in cavalier attendance upon the school of females_ you invariably see a male of full grown magnitude_ but not old_ who_ upon any alarm_ evinces his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his ladies_ in truth_ this gentleman is a luxurious ottoman_ swimming about over the watery world_ surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces and endearments of the harem_ the contrast between this ottoman and his concubines is striking_ because_ while he is always of the largest leviathanic proportions_ the ladies_ even at full growth_ are not more than one_third of the bulk of an average_sized male_ they are comparatively delicate_ indeed_ i dare say_ not to exceed half a dozen yards round the waist_ nevertheless_ it cannot be denied_ that upon the whole they are hereditarily entitled to embonpoint_ it is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent ramblings_ like fashionables_ they are for ever on the move in leisurely search of variety_ you meet them on the line in time for the full flower of the equatorial feeding season_ having just returned_ perhaps_ from spending the summer in the northern seas_ and so cheating summer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth_ by the time they have lounged up and down the promenade of the equator awhile_ they start for the oriental waters in anticipation of the cool season there_ and so evade the other excessive temperature of the year_ when serenely advancing on one of these journeys_ if any strange suspicious sights are seen_ my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his interesting family_ should any unwarrantably pert young leviathan coming that way_ presume to draw confidentially close to one of the ladies_ with what prodigious fury the bashaw assails him_ and chases him away_ high times_ indeed_ if unprincipled young rakes like him are to be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss_ though do what the bashaw will_ he cannot keep the most notorious lothario out of his bed_ for_ alas_ all fish bed in common_ as ashore_ the ladies often cause the most terrible duels among their rival admirers_ just so with the whales_ who sometimes come to deadly battle_ and all for love_ they fence with their long lower jaws_ sometimes locking them together_ and so striving for the supremacy like elks that warringly interweave their antlers_ not a few are captured having the deep scars of these encounters__furrowed heads_ broken teeth_ scolloped fins_ and in some instances_ wrenched and dislocated mouths_ but supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at the first rush of the harem_s lord_ then is it very diverting to watch that lord_ gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and revels there awhile_ still in tantalizing vicinity to young lothario_ like pious solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines_ granting other whales to be in sight_ the fishermen will seldom give chase to one of these grand turks_ for these grand turks are too lavish of their strength_ and hence their unctuousness is small_ as for the sons and the daughters they beget_ why_ those sons and daughters must take care of themselves_ at least_ with only the maternal help_ for like certain other omnivorous roving lovers that might be named_ my lord whale has no taste for the nursery_ however much for the bower_ and so_ being a great traveller_ he leaves his anonymous babies all over the world_ every baby an exotic_ in good time_ nevertheless_ as the ardour of youth declines_ as years and dumps increase_ as reflection lends her solemn pauses_ in short_ as a general lassitude overtakes the sated turk_ then a love of ease and virtue supplants the love for maidens_ our ottoman enters upon the impotent_ repentant_ admonitory stage of life_ forswears_ disbands the harem_ and grown to an exemplary_ sulky old soul_ goes about all alone among the meridians and parallels saying his prayers_ and warning each young leviathan from his amorous errors_ now_ as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school_ so is the lord and master of that school technically known as the schoolmaster_ it is therefore not in strict character_ however admirably satirical_ that after going to school himself_ he should then go abroad inculcating not what he learned there_ but the folly of it_ his title_ schoolmaster_ would very naturally seem derived from the name bestowed upon the harem itself_ but some have surmised that the man who first thus entitled this sort of ottoman whale_ must have read the memoirs of vidocq_ and informed himself what sort of a country_schoolmaster that famous frenchman was in his younger days_ and what was the nature of those occult lessons he inculcated into some of his pupils_ the same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale betakes himself in his advancing years_ is true of all aged sperm whales_ almost universally_ a lone whale_as a solitary leviathan is called_proves an ancient one_ like venerable moss_bearded daniel boone_ he will have no one near him but nature herself_ and her he takes to wife in the wilderness of waters_ and the best of wives she is_ though she keeps so many moody secrets_ the schools composing none but young and vigorous males_ previously mentioned_ offer a strong contrast to the harem schools_ for while those female whales are characteristically timid_ the young males_ or forty_barrel_bulls_ as they call them_ are by far the most pugnacious of all leviathans_ and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter_ excepting those wondrous grey_headed_ grizzled whales_ sometimes met_ and these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a penal gout_ the forty_barrel_bull schools are larger than the harem schools_ like a mob of young collegians_ they are full of fight_ fun_ and wickedness_ tumbling round the world at such a reckless_ rollicking rate_ that no prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous lad at yale or harvard_ they soon relinquish this turbulence though_ and when about three_fourths grown_ break up_ and separately go about in quest of settlements_ that is_ harems_ another point of difference between the male and female schools is still more characteristic of the sexes_ say you strike a forty_barrel_bull_poor devil_ all his comrades quit him_ but strike a member of the harem school_ and her companions swim around her with every token of concern_ sometimes lingering so near her and so long_ as themselves to fall a prey_ chapter ___ fast_fish and loose_fish_ the allusion to the waif and waif_poles in the last chapter but one_ necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale fishery_ of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge_ it frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company_ a whale may be struck by one vessel_ then escape_ and be finally killed and captured by another vessel_ and herein are indirectly comprised many minor contingencies_ all partaking of this one grand feature_ for example__after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale_ the body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm_ and drifting far away to leeward_ be retaken by a second whaler_ who_ in a calm_ snugly tows it alongside_ without risk of life or line_ thus the most vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between the fishermen_ were there not some written or unwritten_ universal_ undisputed law applicable to all cases_ perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative enactment_ was that of holland_ it was decreed by the states_general in a_d_ _____ but though no other nation has ever had any written whaling law_ yet the american fishermen have been their own legislators and lawyers in this matter_ they have provided a system which for terse comprehensiveness surpasses justinian_s pandects and the by_laws of the chinese society for the suppression of meddling with other people_s business_ yes_ these laws might be engraven on a queen anne_s farthing_ or the barb of a harpoon_ and worn round the neck_ so small are they_ i_ a fast_fish belongs to the party fast to it_ ii_ a loose_fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it_ but what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable brevity of it_ which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to expound it_ first_ what is a fast_fish_ alive or dead a fish is technically fast_ when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat_ by any medium at all controllable by the occupant or occupants__a mast_ an oar_ a nine_inch cable_ a telegraph wire_ or a strand of cobweb_ it is all the same_ likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif_ or any other recognised symbol of possession_ so long as the party waifing it plainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside_ as well as their intention so to do_ these are scientific commentaries_ but the commentaries of the whalemen themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks_the coke_upon_littleton of the fist_ true_ among the more upright and honourable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases_ where it would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party_ but others are by no means so scrupulous_ some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale_trover litigated in england_ wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of a whale in the northern seas_ and when indeed they _the plaintiffs_ had succeeded in harpooning the fish_ they were at last_ through peril of their lives_ obliged to forsake not only their lines_ but their boat itself_ ultimately the defendants _the crew of another ship_ came up with the whale_ struck_ killed_ seized_ and finally appropriated it before the very eyes of the plaintiffs_ and when those defendants were remonstrated with_ their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs_ teeth_ and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had done_ he would now retain their line_ harpoons_ and boat_ which had remained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure_ wherefore the plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale_ line_ harpoons_ and boat_ mr_ erskine was counsel for the defendants_ lord ellenborough was the judge_ in the course of the defence_ the witty erskine went on to illustrate his position_ by alluding to a recent crim_ con_ case_ wherein a gentleman_ after in vain trying to bridle his wife_s viciousness_ had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life_ but in the course of years_ repenting of that step_ he instituted an action to recover possession of her_ erskine was on the other side_ and he then supported it by saying_ that though the gentleman had originally harpooned the lady_ and had once had her fast_ and only by reason of the great stress of her plunging viciousness_ had at last abandoned her_ yet abandon her he did_ so that she became a loose_fish_ and therefore when a subsequent gentleman re_harpooned her_ the lady then became that subsequent gentleman_s property_ along with whatever harpoon might have been found sticking in her_ now in the present case erskine contended that the examples of the whale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other_ these pleadings_ and the counter pleadings_ being duly heard_ the very learned judge in set terms decided_ to wit__that as for the boat_ he awarded it to the plaintiffs_ because they had merely abandoned it to save their lives_ but that with regard to the controverted whale_ harpoons_ and line_ they belonged to the defendants_ the whale_ because it was a loose_fish at the time of the final capture_ and the harpoons and line because when the fish made off with them_ it _the fish_ acquired a property in those articles_ and hence anybody who afterwards took the fish had a right to them_ now the defendants afterwards took the fish_ ergo_ the aforesaid articles were theirs_ a common man looking at this decision of the very learned judge_ might possibly object to it_ but ploughed up to the primary rock of the matter_ the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws previously quoted_ and applied and elucidated by lord ellenborough in the above cited case_ these two laws touching fast_fish and loose_fish_ i say_ will_ on reflection_ be found the fundamentals of all human jurisprudence_ for notwithstanding its complicated tracery of sculpture_ the temple of the law_ like the temple of the philistines_ has but two props to stand on_ is it not a saying in every one_s mouth_ possession is half of the law_ that is_ regardless of how the thing came into possession_ but often possession is the whole of the law_ what are the sinews and souls of russian serfs and republican slaves but fast_fish_ whereof possession is the whole of the law_ what to the rapacious landlord is the widow_s last mite but a fast_fish_ what is yonder undetected villain_s marble mansion with a door_plate for a waif_ what is that but a fast_fish_ what is the ruinous discount which mordecai_ the broker_ gets from poor woebegone_ the bankrupt_ on a loan to keep woebegone_s family from starvation_ what is that ruinous discount but a fast_fish_ what is

to that apostolic lancer_ brother jonathan_ is texas but a fast_fish_ and concerning all these_ is not possession the whole of the law_ but if the doctrine of fast_fish be pretty generally applicable_ the kindred doctrine of loose_fish is still more widely so_ that is internationally and universally applicable_ what was america in ____ but a loose_fish_ in which columbus struck the spanish standard

chapter ___ heads or tails_ _de balena vero sufficit_ si rex habeat caput_ et regina caudam__ bracton_ l_ __ c_ __ latin from the books of the laws of england_ which taken along with the context_ means_ that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of that land_ the king_ as honourary grand harpooneer_ must have the head_ and the queen be respectfully presented with the tail_ a division which_ in the whale_ is much like halving an apple_ there is no intermediate remainder_ now as this law_ under a modified form_ is to this day in force in england_ and as it offers in various respects a strange anomaly touching the general law of fast and loose_fish_ it is here treated of in a separate chapter_ on the same courteous principle that prompts the english railways to be at the expense of a separate car_ specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty_ in the first place_ in curious proof of the fact that the above_mentioned law is still in force_ i proceed to lay before you a circumstance that happened within the last two years_ it seems that some honest mariners of dover_ or sandwich_ or some one of the cinque ports_ had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and beaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from the shore_ now the cinque ports are partially or somehow under the jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle_ called a lord warden_ holding the office directly from the crown_ i believe_ all the royal emoluments incident to the cinque port territories become by assignment his_ by some writers this office is called a sinecure_ but not so_ because the lord warden is busily employed at times in fobbing his perquisites_ which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of them_ now when these poor sun_burnt mariners_ bare_footed_ and with their trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs_ had wearily hauled their fat fish high and dry_ promising themselves a good l___ from the precious oil and bone_ and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their wives_ and good ale with their cronies_ upon the strength of their respective shares_ up steps a very learned and most christian and charitable gentleman_ with a copy of blackstone under his arm_ and laying it upon the whale_s head_ he says__hands off_ this fish_ my masters_ is a fast_fish_ i seize it as the lord warden_s__ upon this the poor mariners in their respectful consternation_so truly english_knowing not what to say_ fall to vigorously scratching their heads all round_ meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the stranger_ but that did in nowise mend the matter_ or at all soften the hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of blackstone_ at length one of them_ after long scratching about for his ideas_ made bold to speak_ _please_ sir_ who is the lord warden__ _the duke__ _but the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish__ _it is his__ _we have been at great trouble_ and peril_ and some expense_ and is all that to go to the duke_s benefit_ we getting nothing at all for our pains but our blisters__ _it is his__ _is the duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of getting a livelihood__ _it is his__ _i thought to relieve my old bed_ridden mother by part of my share of this whale__ _it is his__ _won_t the duke be content with a quarter or a half__ _it is his__ in a word_ the whale was seized and sold_ and his grace the duke of wellington received the money_ thinking that viewed in some particular lights_ the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be deemed_ under the circumstances_ a rather hard one_ an honest clergyman of the town respectfully addressed a note to his grace_ begging him to take the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration_ to which my lord duke in substance replied _both letters were published_ that he had already done so_ and received the money_ and would be obliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he _the reverend gentleman_ would decline meddling with other people_s business_ is this the still militant old man_ standing at the corners of the three kingdoms_ on all hands coercing alms of beggars_ it will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the duke to the whale was a delegated one from the sovereign_ we must needs inquire then on what principle the sovereign is originally invested with that right_ the law itself has already been set forth_ but plowdon gives us the reason for it_ says plowdon_ the whale so caught belongs to the king and queen_ _because of its superior excellence__ and by the soundest commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument in such matters_ but why should the king have the head_ and the queen the tail_ a reason for that_ ye lawyers_ in his treatise on _queen_gold__ or queen_pinmoney_ an old king_s bench author_ one william prynne_ thus discourseth_ _ye tail is ye queen_s_ that ye queen_s wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone__ now this was written at a time when the black limber bone of the greenland or right whale was largely used in ladies_ bodices_ but this same bone is not in the tail_ it is in the head_ which is a sad mistake for a sagacious lawyer like prynne_ but is the queen a mermaid_ to be presented with a tail_ an allegorical meaning may lurk here_ there are two royal fish so styled by the english law writers_the whale and the sturgeon_ both royal property under certain limitations_ and nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown_s ordinary revenue_ i know not that any other author has hinted of the matter_ but by inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same way as the whale_ the king receiving the highly dense and elastic head peculiar to that fish_ which_ symbolically regarded_ may possibly be humorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality_ and thus there seems a reason in all things_ even in law_ chapter ___ the pequod meets the rose_bud_ _in vain it was to rake for ambergriese in the paunch of this leviathan_ insufferable fetor denying not inquiry__ sir t_ browne_ v_e_ it was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted_ and when we were slowly sailing over a sleepy_ vapoury_ mid_day sea_ that the many noses on the pequod_s deck proved more vigilant discoverers than the three pairs of eyes aloft_ a peculiar and not very pleasant smell was smelt in the sea_ _i will bet something now__ said stubb_ _that somewhere hereabouts are some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day_ i thought they would keel up before long__ presently_ the vapours in advance slid aside_ and there in the distance lay a ship_ whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must be alongside_ as we glided nearer_ the stranger showed french colours from his peak_ and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea_fowl that circled_ and hovered_ and swooped around him_ it was plain that the whale alongside must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale_ that is_ a whale that has died unmolested on the sea_ and so floated an unappropriated corpse_ it may well be conceived_ what an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale_ worse than an assyrian city in the plague_ when the living are incompetent to bury the departed_ so intolerable indeed is it regarded by some_ that no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it_ yet are there those who will still do it_ notwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality_ and by no means of the nature of attar_of_rose_ coming still nearer with the expiring breeze_ we saw that the frenchman had a second whale alongside_ and this second whale seemed even more of a nosegay than the first_ in truth_ it turned out to be one of those problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of prodigious dyspepsia_ or indigestion_ leaving their defunct bodies almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil_ nevertheless_ in the proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up his nose at such a whale as this_ however much he may shun blasted whales in general_ the pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger_ that stubb vowed he recognised his cutting spade_pole entangled in the lines that were knotted round the tail of one of these whales_ _there_s a pretty fellow_ now__ he banteringly laughed_ standing in the ship_s bows_ _there_s a jackal for ye_ i well know that these crappoes of frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery_ sometimes lowering their boats for breakers_ mistaking them for sperm whale spouts_ yes_ and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of tallow candles_ and cases of snuffers_ foreseeing that all the oil they will get won_t be enough to dip the captain_s wick into_ aye_ we all know these things_ but look ye_ here_s a crappo that is content with our leavings_ the drugged whale there_ i mean_ aye_ and is content too with scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there_ poor devil_ i say_ pass round a hat_ some one_ and let_s make him a present of a little oil for dear charity_s sake_ for what oil he_ll get from that drugged whale there_ wouldn_t be fit to burn in a jail_ no_ not in a condemned cell_ and as for the other whale_ why_ i_ll agree to get more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours_ than he_ll get from that bundle of bones_ though_ now that i think of it_ it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil_ yes_ ambergris_ i wonder now if our old man has thought of that_ it_s worth trying_ yes_ i_m for it__ and so saying he started for the quarter_deck_ by this time the faint air had become a complete calm_ so that whether or no_ the pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell_ with no hope of escaping except by its breezing up again_ issuing from the cabin_ stubb now called his boat_s crew_ and pulled off for the stranger_ drawing across her bow_ he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful french taste_ the upper part of her stem_piece was carved in the likeness of a huge drooping stalk_ was painted green_ and for thorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there_ the whole terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour_ upon her head boards_ in large gilt letters_ he read _bouton de rose___rose_button_ or rose_bud_ and this was the romantic name of this aromatic ship_ though stubb did not understand the bouton part of the inscription_ yet the word rose_ and the bulbous figure_head put together_ sufficiently explained the whole to him_ _a wooden rose_bud_ eh__ he cried with his hand to his nose_ _that will do very well_ but how like all creation it smells__ now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck_ he had to pull round the bows to the starboard side_ and thus come close to the blasted whale_ and so talk over it_ arrived then at this spot_ with one hand still to his nose_ he bawled__bouton_de_rose_ ahoy_ are there any of you bouton_de_roses that speak english__ _yes__ rejoined a guernsey_man from the bulwarks_ who turned out to be the chief_mate_ _well_ then_ my bouton_de_rose_bud_ have you seen the white whale__ _what whale__ _the white whale_a sperm whale_moby dick_ have ye seen him_ _never heard of such a whale_ cachalot blanche_ white whale_no__ _very good_ then_ good bye now_ and i_ll call again in a minute__ then rapidly pulling back towards the pequod_ and seeing ahab leaning over the quarter_deck rail awaiting his report_ he moulded his two hands into a trumpet and shouted__no_ sir_ no__ upon which ahab retired_ and stubb returned to the frenchman_ he now perceived that the guernsey_man_ who had just got into the chains_ and was using a cutting_spade_ had slung his nose in a sort of bag_ _what_s the matter with your nose_ there__ said stubb_ _broke it__ _i wish it was broken_ or that i didn_t have any nose at all__ answered the guernsey_man_ who did not seem to relish the job he was at very much_ _but what are you holding yours for__ _oh_ nothing_ it_s a wax nose_ i have to hold it on_ fine day_ ain_t it_ air rather gardenny_ i should say_ throw us a bunch of posies_ will ye_ bouton_de_rose__ _what in the devil_s name do you want here__ roared the guernseyman_ flying into a sudden passion_ _oh_ keep cool_cool_ yes_ that_s the word_ why don_t you pack those whales in ice while you_re working at _em_ but joking aside_ though_ do you know_ rose_bud_ that it_s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of such whales_ as for that dried up one_ there_ he hasn_t a gill in his whole carcase__ _i know that well enough_ but_ d_ye see_ the captain here won_t believe it_ this is his first voyage_ he was a cologne manufacturer before_ but come aboard_ and mayhap he_ll believe you_ if he won_t me_ and so i_ll get out of this dirty scrape__ _anything to oblige ye_ my sweet and pleasant fellow__ rejoined stubb_ and with that he soon mounted to the deck_ there a queer scene presented itself_ the sailors_ in tasselled caps of red worsted_ were getting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales_ but they worked rather slow and talked very fast_ and seemed in anything but a good humor_ all their noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many jib_booms_ now and then pairs of them would drop their work_ and run up to the mast_head to get some fresh air_ some thinking they would catch the plague_ dipped oakum in coal_tar_ and at intervals held it to their nostrils_ others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short off at the bowl_ were vigorously puffing tobacco_smoke_ so that it constantly filled their olfactories_ stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from the captain_s round_house abaft_ and looking in that direction saw a fiery face thrust from behind the door_ which was held ajar from within_ this was the tormented surgeon_ who_ after in vain remonstrating against the proceedings of the day_ had betaken himself to the captain_s round_house _cabinet he called it_ to avoid the pest_ but still_ could not help yelling out his entreaties and indignations at times_ marking all this_ stubb argued well for his scheme_ and turning to the guernsey_man had a little chat with him_ during which the stranger mate expressed his detestation of his captain as a conceited ignoramus_ who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle_ sounding him carefully_ stubb further perceived that the guernsey_man had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris_ he therefore held his peace on that head_ but otherwise was quite frank and confidential with him_ so that the two quickly concocted a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the captain_ without his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity_ according to this little plan of theirs_ the guernsey_man_ under cover of an interpreter_s office_ was to tell the captain what he pleased_ but as coming from stubb_ and as for stubb_ he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the interview_ by this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin_ he was a small and dark_ but rather delicate looking man for a sea_captain_ with large whiskers and moustache_ however_ and wore a red cotton velvet vest with watch_seals at his side_ to this gentleman_ stubb was now politely introduced by the guernsey_man_ who at once ostentatiously put on the aspect of interpreting between them_ _what shall i say to him first__ said he_ _why__ said stubb_ eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals_ _you may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me_ though i don_t pretend to be a judge__ _he says_ monsieur__ said the guernsey_man_ in french_ turning to his captain_ _that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel_ whose captain and chief_mate_ with six sailors_ had all died of a fever caught from a blasted whale they had brought alongside__ upon this the captain started_ and eagerly desired to know more_ _what now__ said the guernsey_man to stubb_ _why_ since he takes it so easy_ tell him that now i have eyed him carefully_ i_m quite certain that he_s no more fit to command a whale_ship than a st_ jago monkey_ in fact_ tell him from me he_s a baboon__ _he vows and declares_ monsieur_ that the other whale_ the dried one_ is far more deadly than the blasted one_ in fine_ monsieur_ he conjures us_ as we value our lives_ to cut loose from these fish__ instantly the captain ran forward_ and in a loud voice commanded his crew to desist from hoisting the cutting_tackles_ and at once cast loose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship_ _what now__ said the guernsey_man_ when the captain had returned to them_ _why_ let me see_ yes_ you may as well tell him now that_that_in fact_ tell him i_ve diddled him_ and _aside to himself_ perhaps somebody else__ _he says_ monsieur_ that he_s very happy to have been of any service to us__ hearing this_ the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties _meaning himself and mate_ and concluded by inviting stubb down into his cabin to drink a bottle of bordeaux_ _he wants you to take a glass of wine with him__ said the interpreter_ _thank him heartily_ but tell him it_s against my principles to drink with the man i_ve diddled_ in fact_ tell him i must go__ _he says_ monsieur_ that his principles won_t admit of his drinking_ but that if monsieur wants to live another day to drink_ then monsieur had best drop all four boats_ and pull the ship away from these whales_ for it_s so calm they won_t drift__ by this time stubb was over the side_ and getting into his boat_ hailed the guernsey_man to this effect__that having a long tow_line in his boat_ he would do what he could to help them_ by pulling out the lighter whale of the two from the ship_s side_ while the frenchman_s boats_ then_ were engaged in towing the ship one way_ stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way_ ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long tow_line_ presently a breeze sprang up_ stubb feigned to cast off from the whale_ hoisting his boats_ the frenchman soon increased his distance_ while the pequod slid in between him and stubb_s whale_ whereupon stubb quickly pulled to the floating body_ and hailing the pequod to give notice of his intentions_ at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous cunning_ seizing his sharp boat_spade_ he commenced an excavation in the body_ a little behind the side fin_ you would almost have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea_ and when at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs_ it was like turning up old roman tiles and pottery buried in fat english loam_ his boat_s crew were all in high excitement_ eagerly helping their chief_ and looking as anxious as gold_hunters_ and all the time numberless fowls were diving_ and ducking_ and screaming_ and yelling_ and fighting around them_ stubb was beginning to look disappointed_ especially as the horrible nosegay increased_ when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague_ there stole a faint stream of perfume_ which flowed through the tide of bad smells without being absorbed by it_ as one river will flow into and then along with another_ without at all blending with it for a time_ _i have it_ i have it__ cried stubb_ with delight_ striking something in the subterranean regions_ _a purse_ a purse__ dropping his spade_ he thrust both hands in_ and drew out handfuls of something that looked like ripe windsor soap_ or rich mottled old cheese_ very unctuous and savory withal_ you might easily dent it with your thumb_ it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour_ and this_ good friends_ is ambergris_ worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist_ some six handfuls were obtained_ but more was unavoidably lost in the sea_ and still more_ perhaps_ might have been secured were it not for impatient ahab_s loud command to stubb to desist_ and come on board_ else the ship would bid them good bye_ chapter ___ ambergris_ now this ambergris is a very curious substance_ and so important as an article of commerce_ that in ____ a certain nantucket_born captain coffin was examined at the bar of the english house of commons on that subject_ for at that time_ and indeed until a comparatively late day_ the precise origin of ambergris remained_ like amber itself_ a problem to the learned_ though the word ambergris is but the french compound for grey amber_ yet the two substances are quite distinct_ for amber_ though at times found on the sea_coast_ is also dug up in some far inland soils_ whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea_ besides_ amber is a hard_ transparent_ brittle_ odorless substance_ used for mouth_pieces to pipes_ for beads and ornaments_ but ambergris is soft_ waxy_ and so highly fragrant and spicy_ that it is largely used in perfumery_ in pastiles_ precious candles_ hair_powders_ and pomatum_ the turks use it in cooking_ and also carry it to mecca_ for the same purpose that frankincense is carried to st_ peter_s in rome_ some wine merchants drop a few grains into claret_ to flavor it_ who would think_ then_ that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick whale_ yet so it is_ by some_ ambergris is supposed to be the cause_ and by others the effect_ of the dyspepsia in the whale_ how to cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say_ unless by administering three or four boat loads of brandreth_s pills_ and then running out of harm_s way_ as laborers do in blasting rocks_ i have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris_ certain hard_ round_ bony plates_ which at first stubb thought might be sailors_ trowsers buttons_ but it afterwards turned out that they were nothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner_ now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be found in the heart of such decay_ is this nothing_ bethink thee of that saying of st_ paul in corinthians_ about corruption and incorruption_ how that we are sown in dishonour_ but raised in glory_ and likewise call to mind that saying of paracelsus about what it is that maketh the best musk_ also forget not the strange fact that of all things of ill_savor_ cologne_water_ in its rudimental manufacturing stages_ is the worst_ i should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal_ but cannot_ owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against whalemen_ and which_ in the estimation of some already biased minds_ might be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said of the frenchman_s two whales_ elsewhere in this volume the slanderous aspersion has been disproved_ that the vocation of whaling is throughout a slatternly_ untidy business_ but there is another thing to rebut_ they hint that all whales always smell bad_ now how did this odious stigma originate_ i opine_ that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the greenland whaling ships in london_ more than two centuries ago_ because those whalemen did not then_ and do not now_ try out their oil at sea as the southern ships have always done_ but cutting up the fresh blubber in small bits_ thrust it through the bung holes of large casks_ and carry it home in that manner_ the shortness of the season in those icy seas_ and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed_ forbidding any other course_ the consequence is_ that upon breaking into the hold_ and unloading one of these whale cemeteries_ in the greenland dock_ a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an old city grave_yard_ for the foundations of a lying_in_hospital_ i partly surmise also_ that this wicked charge against whalers may be likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of greenland_ in former times_ of a dutch village called schmerenburgh or smeerenberg_ which latter name is the one used by the learned fogo von slack_ in his great work on smells_ a text_book on that subject_ as its name imports _smeer_ fat_ berg_ to put up__ this village was founded in order to afford a place for the blubber of the dutch whale fleet to be tried out_ without being taken home to holland for that purpose_ it was a collection of furnaces_ fat_kettles_ and oil sheds_ and when the works were in full operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor_ but all this is quite different with a south sea sperm whaler_ which in a voyage of four years perhaps_ after completely filling her hold with oil_ does not_ perhaps_ consume fifty days in the business of boiling out_ and in the state that it is casked_ the oil is nearly scentless_ the truth is_ that living or dead_ if but decently treated_ whales as a species are by no means creatures of ill odor_ nor can whalemen be recognised_ as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a jew in the company_ by the nose_ nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant_ when_ as a general thing_ he enjoys such high health_ taking abundance of exercise_ always out of doors_ though_ it is true_ seldom in the open air_ i say_ that the motion of a sperm whale_s flukes above water dispenses a perfume_ as when a musk_scented lady rustles her dress in a warm parlor_ what then shall i liken the sperm whale to for fragrance_ considering his magnitude_ must it not be to that famous elephant_ with jewelled tusks_ and redolent with myrrh_ which was led out of an indian town to do honour to alexander the great_ chapter ___ the castaway_ it was but some few days after encountering the frenchman_ that a most significant event befell the most insignificant of the pequod_s crew_ an event most lamentable_ and which ended in providing the sometimes madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own_ now_ in the whale ship_ it is not every one that goes in the boats_ some few hands are reserved called ship_keepers_ whose province it is to work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale_ as a general thing_ these ship_keepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising the boats_ crews_ but if there happen to be an unduly slender_ clumsy_ or timorous wight in the ship_ that wight is certain to be made a ship_keeper_ it was so in the pequod with the little negro pippin by nick_name_ pip by abbreviation_ poor pip_ ye have heard of him before_ ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight_ so gloomy_jolly_ in outer aspect_ pip and dough_boy made a match_ like a black pony and a white one_ of equal developments_ though of dissimilar colour_ driven in one eccentric span_ but while hapless dough_boy was by nature dull and torpid in his intellects_ pip_ though over tender_hearted_ was at bottom very bright_ with that pleasant_ genial_ jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe_ a tribe_ which ever enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer_ freer relish than any other race_ for blacks_ the year_s calendar should show naught but three hundred and sixty_five fourth of julys and new year_s days_ nor smile so_ while i write that this little black was brilliant_ for even blackness has its brilliancy_ behold yon lustrous ebony_ panelled in king_s cabinets_ but pip loved life_ and all life_s peaceable securities_ so that the panic_striking business in which he had somehow unaccountably become entrapped_ had most sadly blurred his brightness_ though_ as ere long will be seen_ what was thus temporarily subdued in him_ in the end was destined to be luridly illumined by strange wild fires_ that fictitiously showed him off to ten times the natural lustre with which in his native tolland county in connecticut_ he had once enlivened many a fiddler_s frolic on the green_ and at melodious even_tide_ with his gay ha_ha_ had turned the round horizon into one star_belled tambourine_ so_ though in the clear air of day_ suspended against a blue_veined neck_ the pure_watered diamond drop will healthful glow_ yet_ when the cunning jeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre_ he lays it against a gloomy ground_ and then lights it up_ not by the sun_ but by some unnatural gases_ then come out those fiery effulgences_ infernally superb_ then the evil_blazing diamond_ once the divinest symbol of the crystal skies_ looks like some crown_jewel stolen from the king of hell_ but let us to the story_ it came to pass_ that in the ambergris affair stubb_s after_oarsman chanced so to sprain his hand_ as for a time to become quite maimed_ and_ temporarily_ pip was put into his place_ the first time stubb lowered with him_ pip evinced much nervousness_ but happily_ for that time_ escaped close contact with the whale_ and therefore came off not altogether discreditably_ though stubb observing him_ took care_ afterwards_ to exhort him to cherish his courageousness to the utmost_ for he might often find it needful_ now upon the second lowering_ the boat paddled upon the whale_ and as the fish received the darted iron_ it gave its customary rap_ which happened_ in this instance_ to be right under poor pip_s seat_ the involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap_ paddle in hand_ out of the boat_ and in such a way_ that part of the slack whale line coming against his chest_ he breasted it overboard with him_ so as to become entangled in it_ when at last plumping into the water_ that instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run_ the line swiftly straightened_ and presto_ poor pip came all foaming up to the chocks of the boat_ remorselessly dragged there by the line_ which had taken several turns around his chest and neck_ tashtego stood in the bows_ he was full of the fire of the hunt_ he hated pip for a poltroon_ snatching the boat_knife from its sheath_ he suspended its sharp edge over the line_ and turning towards stubb_ exclaimed interrogatively_ _cut__ meantime pip_s blue_ choked face plainly looked_ do_ for god_s sake_ all passed in a flash_ in less than half a minute_ this entire thing happened_ _damn him_ cut__ roared stubb_ and so the whale was lost and pip was saved_ so soon as he recovered himself_ the poor little negro was assailed by yells and execrations from the crew_ tranquilly permitting these irregular cursings to evaporate_ stubb then in a plain_ business_like_ but still half humorous manner_ cursed pip officially_ and that done_ unofficially gave him much wholesome advice_ the substance was_ never jump from a boat_ pip_ except_but all the rest was indefinite_ as the soundest advice ever is_ now_ in general_ stick to the boat_ is your true motto in whaling_ but cases will sometimes happen when leap from the boat_ is still better_ moreover_ as if perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted conscientious advice to pip_ he would be leaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future_ stubb suddenly dropped all advice_ and concluded with a peremptory command_ _stick to the boat_ pip_ or by the lord_ i won_t pick you up if you jump_ mind that_ we can_t afford to lose whales by the likes of you_ a whale would sell for thirty times what you would_ pip_ in alabama_ bear that in mind_ and don_t jump any more__ hereby perhaps stubb indirectly hinted_ that though man loved his fellow_ yet man is a money_making animal_ which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence_ but we are all in the hands of the gods_ and pip jumped again_ it was under very similar circumstances to the first performance_ but this time he did not breast out the line_ and hence_ when the whale started to run_ pip was left behind on the sea_ like a hurried traveller_s trunk_ alas_ stubb was but too true to his word_ it was a beautiful_ bounteous_ blue day_ the spangled sea calm and cool_ and flatly stretching away_ all round_ to the horizon_ like gold_beater_s skin hammered out to the extremest_ bobbing up and down in that sea_ pip_s ebon head showed like a head of cloves_ no boat_knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern_ stubb_s inexorable back was turned upon him_ and the whale was winged_ in three minutes_ a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between pip and stubb_ out from the centre of the sea_ poor pip turned his crisp_ curling_ black head to the sun_ another lonely castaway_ though the loftiest and the brightest_ now_ in calm weather_ to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the practised swimmer as to ride in a spring_carriage ashore_ but the awful lonesomeness is intolerable_ the intense concentration of self in the middle of such a heartless immensity_ my god_ who can tell it_ mark_ how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea_mark how closely they hug their ship and only coast along her sides_ but had stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate_ no_ he did not mean to_ at least_ because there were two boats in his wake_ and he supposed_ no doubt_ that they would of course come up to pip very quickly_ and pick him up_ though_ indeed_ such considerations towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity_ is not always manifested by the hunters in all similar instances_ and such instances not unfrequently occur_ almost invariably in the fishery_ a coward_ so called_ is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to military navies and armies_ but it so happened_ that those boats_ without seeing pip_ suddenly spying whales close to them on one side_ turned_ and gave chase_ and stubb_s boat was now so far away_ and he and all his crew so intent upon his fish_ that pip_s ringed horizon began to expand around him miserably_ by the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him_ but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot_ such_ at least_ they said he was_ the sea had jeeringly kept his finite body up_ but drowned the infinite of his soul_ not drowned entirely_ though_ rather carried down alive to wondrous depths_ where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes_ and the miser_merman_ wisdom_ revealed his hoarded heaps_ and among the joyous_ heartless_ ever_juvenile eternities_ pip saw the multitudinous_ god_omnipresent_ coral insects_ that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs_ he saw god_s foot upon the treadle of the loom_ and spoke it_ and therefore his shipmates called him mad_ so man_s insanity is heaven_s sense_ and wandering from all mortal reason_ man comes at last to that celestial thought_ which_ to reason_ is absurd and frantic_ and weal or woe_ feels then uncompromised_ indifferent as his god_ for the rest_ blame not stubb too hardly_ the thing is common in that fishery_ and in the sequel of the narrative_ it will then be seen what like abandonment befell myself_ chapter ___ a squeeze of the hand_ that whale of stubb_s_ so dearly purchased_ was duly brought to the pequod_s side_ where all those cutting and hoisting operations previously detailed_ were regularly gone through_ even to the baling of the heidelburgh tun_ or case_ while some were occupied with this latter duty_ others were employed in dragging away the larger tubs_ so soon as filled with the sperm_ and when the proper time arrived_ this same sperm was carefully manipulated ere going to the try_works_ of which anon_ it had cooled and crystallized to such a degree_ that when_ with several others_ i sat down before a large constantine_s bath of it_ i found it strangely concreted into lumps_ here and there rolling about in the liquid part_ it was our business to squeeze these lumps back into fluid_ a sweet and unctuous duty_ no wonder that in old times this sperm was such a favourite cosmetic_ such a clearer_ such a sweetener_ such a softener_ such a delicious molifier_ after having my hands in it for only a few minutes_ my fingers felt like eels_ and began_ as it were_ to serpentine and spiralise_ as i sat there at my ease_ cross_legged on the deck_ after the bitter exertion at the windlass_ under a blue tranquil sky_ the ship under indolent sail_ and gliding so serenely along_ as i bathed my hands among those soft_ gentle globules of infiltrated tissues_ woven almost within the hour_ as they richly broke to my fingers_ and discharged all their opulence_ like fully ripe grapes their wine_ as i snuffed up that uncontaminated aroma__literally and truly_ like the smell of spring violets_ i declare to you_ that for the time i lived as in a musky meadow_ i forgot all about our horrible oath_ in that inexpressible sperm_ i washed my hands and my heart of it_ i almost began to credit the old paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in allaying the heat of anger_ while bathing in that bath_ i felt divinely free from all ill_will_ or petulance_ or malice_ of any sort whatsoever_ squeeze_ squeeze_ squeeze_ all the morning long_ i squeezed that sperm till i myself almost melted into it_ i squeezed that sperm till a strange sort of insanity came over me_ and i found myself unwittingly squeezing my co_laborers_ hands in it_ mistaking their hands for the gentle globules_ such an abounding_ affectionate_ friendly_ loving feeling did this avocation beget_ that at last i was continually squeezing their hands_ and looking up into their eyes sentimentally_ as much as to say__oh_ my dear fellow beings_ why should we longer cherish any social acerbities_ or know the slightest ill_humor or envy_ come_ let us squeeze hands all round_ nay_ let us all squeeze ourselves into each other_ let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness_ would that i could keep squeezing that sperm for ever_ for now_ since by many prolonged_ repeated experiences_ i have perceived that in all cases man must eventually lower_ or at least shift_ his conceit of attainable felicity_ not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy_ but in the wife_ the heart_ the bed_ the table_ the saddle_ the fireside_ the country_ now that i have perceived all this_ i am ready to squeeze case eternally_ in thoughts of the visions of the night_ i saw long rows of angels in paradise_ each with his hands in a jar of spermaceti_ now_ while discoursing of sperm_ it behooves to speak of other things akin to it_ in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the try_works_ first comes white_horse_ so called_ which is obtained from the tapering part of the fish_ and also from the thicker portions of his flukes_ it is tough with congealed tendons_a wad of muscle_but still contains some oil_ after being severed from the whale_ the white_horse is first cut into portable oblongs ere going to the mincer_ they look much like blocks of berkshire marble_ plum_pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the whale_s flesh_ here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber_ and often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness_ it is a most refreshing_ convivial_ beautiful object to behold_ as its name imports_ it is of an exceedingly rich_ mottled tint_ with a bestreaked snowy and golden ground_ dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and purple_ it is plums of rubies_ in pictures of citron_ spite of reason_ it is hard to keep yourself from eating it_ i confess_ that once i stole behind the foremast to try it_ it tasted something as i should conceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of louis le gros might have tasted_ supposing him to have been killed the first day after the venison season_ and that particular venison season contemporary with an unusually fine vintage of the vineyards of champagne_ there is another substance_ and a very singular one_ which turns up in the course of this business_ but which i feel it to be very puzzling adequately to describe_ it is called slobgollion_ an appellation original with the whalemen_ and even so is the nature of the substance_ it is an ineffably oozy_ stringy affair_ most frequently found in the tubs of sperm_ after a prolonged squeezing_ and subsequent decanting_ i hold it to be the wondrously thin_ ruptured membranes of the case_ coalescing_ gurry_ so called_ is a term properly belonging to right whalemen_ but sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen_ it designates the dark_ glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the greenland or right whale_ and much of which covers the decks of those inferior souls who hunt that ignoble leviathan_ nippers_ strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale_s vocabulary_ but as applied by whalemen_ it becomes so_ a whaleman_s nipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering part of leviathan_s tail_ it averages an inch in thickness_ and for the rest_ is about the size of the iron part of a hoe_ edgewise moved along the oily deck_ it operates like a leathern squilgee_ and by nameless blandishments_ as of magic_ allures along with it all impurities_ but to learn all about these recondite matters_ your best way is at once to descend into the blubber_room_ and have a long talk with its inmates_ this place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for the blanket_pieces_ when stript and hoisted from the whale_ when the proper time arrives for cutting up its contents_ this apartment is a scene of terror to all tyros_ especially by night_ on one side_ lit by a dull lantern_ a space has been left clear for the workmen_ they generally go in pairs__a pike_and_gaffman and a spade_man_ the whaling_pike is similar to a frigate_s boarding_weapon of the same name_ the gaff is something like a boat_hook_ with his gaff_ the gaffman hooks on to a sheet of blubber_ and strives to hold it from slipping_ as the ship pitches and lurches about_ meanwhile_ the spade_man stands on the sheet itself_ perpendicularly chopping it into the portable horse_pieces_ this spade is sharp as hone can make it_ the spademan_s feet are shoeless_ the thing he stands on will sometimes irresistibly slide away from him_ like a sledge_ if he cuts off one of his own toes_ or one of his assistants__ would you be very much astonished_ toes are scarce among veteran blubber_room men_ chapter ___ the cassock_ had you stepped on board the pequod at a certain juncture of this post_mortemizing of the whale_ and had you strolled forward nigh the windlass_ pretty sure am i that you would have scanned with no small curiosity a very strange_ enigmatical object_ which you would have seen there_ lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers_ not the wondrous cistern in the whale_s huge head_ not the prodigy of his unhinged lower jaw_ not the miracle of his symmetrical tail_ none of these would so surprise you_ as half a glimpse of that unaccountable cone__longer than a kentuckian is tall_ nigh a foot in diameter at the base_ and jet_black as yojo_ the ebony idol of queequeg_ and an idol_ indeed_ it is_ or_ rather_ in old times_ its likeness was_ such an idol as that found in the secret groves of queen maachah in judea_ and for worshipping which_ king asa_ her son_ did depose her_ and destroyed the idol_ and burnt it for an abomination at the brook kedron_ as darkly set forth in the __th chapter of the first book of kings_ look at the sailor_ called the mincer_ who now comes along_ and assisted by two allies_ heavily backs the grandissimus_ as the mariners call it_ and with bowed shoulders_ staggers off with it as if he were a grenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field_ extending it upon the forecastle deck_ he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its dark pelt_ as an african hunter the pelt of a boa_ this done he turns the pelt inside out_ like a pantaloon leg_ gives it a good stretching_ so as almost to double its diameter_ and at last hangs it_ well spread_ in the rigging_ to dry_ ere long_ it is taken down_ when removing some three feet of it_ towards the pointed extremity_ and then cutting two slits for arm_holes at the other end_ he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it_ the mincer now stands before you invested in the full canonicals of his calling_ immemorial to all his order_ this investiture alone will adequately protect him_ while employed in the peculiar functions of his office_ that office consists in mincing the horse_pieces of blubber for the pots_ an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse_ planted endwise against the bulwarks_ and with a capacious tub beneath it_ into which the minced pieces drop_ fast as the sheets from a rapt orator_s desk_ arrayed in decent black_ occupying a conspicuous pulpit_ intent on bible leaves_ what a candidate for an archbishopric_ what a lad for a pope were this mincer__ _bible leaves_ bible leaves_ this is the invariable cry from the mates to the mincer_ it enjoins him to be careful_ and cut his work into as thin slices as possible_ inasmuch as by so doing the business of boiling out the oil is much accelerated_ and its quantity considerably increased_ besides perhaps improving it in quality_ chapter ___ the try_works_ besides her hoisted boats_ an american whaler is outwardly distinguished by her try_works_ she presents the curious anomaly of the most solid masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the completed ship_ it is as if from the open field a brick_kiln were transported to her planks_ the try_works are planted between the foremast and mainmast_ the most roomy part of the deck_ the timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength_ fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and mortar_ some ten feet by eight square_ and five in height_ the foundation does not penetrate the deck_ but the masonry is firmly secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all sides_ and screwing it down to the timbers_ on the flanks it is cased with wood_ and at top completely covered by a large_ sloping_ battened hatchway_ removing this hatch we expose the great try_pots_ two in number_ and each of several barrels_ capacity_ when not in use_ they are kept remarkably clean_ sometimes they are polished with soapstone and sand_ till they shine within like silver punch_bowls_ during the night_watches some cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil themselves away there for a nap_ while employed in polishing them_one man in each pot_ side by side_many confidential communications are carried on_ over the iron lips_ it is a place also for profound mathematical meditation_ it was in the left hand try_pot of the pequod_ with the soapstone diligently circling round me_ that i was first indirectly struck by the remarkable fact_ that in geometry all bodies gliding along the cycloid_ my soapstone for example_ will descend from any point in precisely the same time_ removing the fire_board from the front of the try_works_ the bare masonry of that side is exposed_ penetrated by the two iron mouths of the furnaces_ directly underneath the pots_ these mouths are fitted with heavy doors of iron_ the intense heat of the fire is prevented from communicating itself to the deck_ by means of a shallow reservoir extending under the entire inclosed surface of the works_ by a tunnel inserted at the rear_ this reservoir is kept replenished with water as fast as it evaporates_ there are no external chimneys_ they open direct from the rear wall_ and here let us go back for a moment_ it was about nine o_clock at night that the pequod_s try_works were first started on this present voyage_ it belonged to stubb to oversee the business_ _all ready there_ off hatch_ then_ and start her_ you cook_ fire the works__ this was an easy thing_ for the carpenter had been thrusting his shavings into the furnace throughout the passage_ here be it said that in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try_works has to be fed for a time with wood_ after that no wood is used_ except as a means of quick ignition to the staple fuel_ in a word_ after being tried out_ the crisp_ shrivelled blubber_ now called scraps or fritters_ still contains considerable of its unctuous properties_ these fritters feed the flames_ like a plethoric burning martyr_ or a self_consuming misanthrope_ once ignited_ the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by his own body_ would that he consumed his own smoke_ for his smoke is horrible to inhale_ and inhale it you must_ and not only that_ but you must live in it for the time_ it has an unspeakable_ wild_ hindoo odor about it_ such as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres_ it smells like the left wing of the day of judgment_ it is an argument for the pit_ by midnight the works were in full operation_ we were clear from the carcase_ sail had been made_ the wind was freshening_ the wild ocean darkness was intense_ but that darkness was licked up by the fierce flames_ which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues_ and illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging_ as with the famed greek fire_ the burning ship drove on_ as if remorselessly commissioned to some vengeful deed_ so the pitch and sulphur_freighted brigs of the bold hydriote_ canaris_ issuing from their midnight harbors_ with broad sheets of flame for sails_ bore down upon the turkish frigates_ and folded them in conflagrations_ the hatch_ removed from the top of the works_ now afforded a wide hearth in front of them_ standing on this were the tartarean shapes of the pagan harpooneers_ always the whale_ship_s stokers_ with huge pronged poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding pots_ or stirred up the fires beneath_ till the snaky flames darted_ curling_ out of the doors to catch them by the feet_ the smoke rolled away in sullen heaps_ to every pitch of the ship there was a pitch of the boiling oil_ which seemed all eagerness to leap into their faces_ opposite the mouth of the works_ on the further side of the wide wooden hearth_ was the windlass_ this served for a sea_sofa_ here lounged the watch_ when not otherwise employed_ looking into the red heat of the fire_ till their eyes felt scorched in their heads_ their tawny features_ now all begrimed with smoke and sweat_ their matted beards_ and the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their teeth_ all these were strangely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of the works_ as they narrated to each other their unholy adventures_ their tales of terror told in words of mirth_ as their uncivilized laughter forked upwards out of them_ like the flames from the furnace_ as to and fro_ in their front_ the harpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged forks and dippers_ as the wind howled on_ and the sea leaped_ and the ship groaned and dived_ and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further and further into the blackness of the sea and the night_ and scornfully champed the white bone in her mouth_ and viciously spat round her on all sides_ then the rushing pequod_ freighted with savages_ and laden with fire_ and burning a corpse_ and plunging into that blackness of darkness_ seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac commander_s soul_ so seemed it to me_ as i stood at her helm_ and for long hours silently guided the way of this fire_ship on the sea_ wrapped_ for that interval_ in darkness myself_ i but the better saw the redness_ the madness_ the ghastliness of others_ the continual sight of the fiend shapes before me_ capering half in smoke and half in fire_ these at last begat kindred visions in my soul_ so soon as i began to yield to that unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over me at a midnight helm_ but that night_ in particular_ a strange _and ever since inexplicable_ thing occurred to me_ starting from a brief standing sleep_ i was horribly conscious of something fatally wrong_ the jaw_bone tiller smote my side_ which leaned against it_ in my ears was the low hum of sails_ just beginning to shake in the wind_ i thought my eyes were open_ i was half conscious of putting my fingers to the lids and mechanically stretching them still further apart_ but_ spite of all this_ i could see no compass before me to steer by_ though it seemed but a minute since i had been watching the card_ by the steady binnacle lamp illuminating it_ nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom_ now and then made ghastly by flashes of redness_ uppermost was the impression_ that whatever swift_ rushing thing i stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern_ a stark_ bewildered feeling_ as of death_ came over me_ convulsively my hands grasped the tiller_ but with the crazy conceit that the tiller was_ somehow_ in some enchanted way_ inverted_ my god_ what is the matter with me_ thought i_ lo_ in my brief sleep i had turned myself about_ and was fronting the ship_s stern_ with my back to her prow and the compass_ in an instant i faced back_ just in time to prevent the vessel from flying up into the wind_ and very probably capsizing her_ how glad and how grateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night_ and the fatal contingency of being brought by the lee_ look not too long in the face of the fire_ o man_ never dream with thy hand on the helm_ turn not thy back to the compass_ accept the first hint of the hitching tiller_ believe not the artificial fire_ when its redness makes all things look ghastly_ to_morrow_ in the natural sun_ the skies will be bright_ those who glared like devils in the forking flames_ the morn will show in far other_ at least gentler_ relief_ the glorious_ golden_ glad sun_ the only true lamp_all others but liars_ nevertheless the sun hides not virginia_s dismal swamp_ nor rome_s accursed campagna_ nor wide sahara_ nor all the millions of miles of deserts and of griefs beneath the moon_ the sun hides not the ocean_ which is the dark side of this earth_ and which is two thirds of this earth_ so_ therefore_ that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow in him_ that mortal man cannot be true_not true_ or undeveloped_ with books the same_ the truest of all men was the man of sorrows_ and the truest of all books is

single moment you would have almost thought you were standing in some illuminated shrine of canonized kings and counsellors_ there they lay in their triangular oaken vaults_ each mariner a chiselled muteness_ a score of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes_ in merchantmen_ oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of queens_ to dress in the dark_ and eat in the dark_ and stumble in darkness

night the ship_s black hull still houses an illumination_ see with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of lamps_often but old bottles and vials_ though_to the copper cooler at the try_works_ and replenishes them there_ as mugs of ale at a vat_ he burns_ too_ the purest of oil_ in its unmanufactured_ and_ therefore_ unvitiated state_ a fluid unknown to solar_ lunar_ or astral contrivances ashore_ it is sweet as early grass butter in april_ he goes and hunts for his oil_ so as to be sure of its freshness and genuineness_ even as the traveller on the prairie hunts up his own supper of game_ chapter ___ stowing down and clearing up_ already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off descried from the mast_head_ how he is chased over the watery moors_ and slaughtered in the valleys of the deep_ how he is then towed alongside and beheaded_ and how _on the principle which entitled the headsman of old to the garments in which the beheaded was killed_ his great padded surtout becomes the property of his executioner_ how_ in due time_ he is condemned to the pots_ and_ like shadrach_ meshach_ and abednego_ his spermaceti_ oil_ and bone pass unscathed through the fire__but now it remains to conclude the last chapter of this part of the description by rehearsing_singing_ if i may_the romantic proceeding of decanting off his oil into the casks and striking them down into the hold_ where once again leviathan returns to his native profundities_ sliding along beneath the surface as before_ but_ alas_ never more to rise and blow_ while still warm_ the oil_ like hot punch_ is received into the six_barrel casks_ and while_ perhaps_ the ship is pitching and rolling this way and that in the midnight sea_ the enormous casks are slewed round and headed over_ end for end_ and sometimes perilously scoot across the slippery deck_ like so many land slides_ till at last man_handled and stayed in their course_ and all round the hoops_ rap_ rap_ go as many hammers as can play upon them_ for now_ ex officio_ every sailor is a cooper_ at length_ when the last pint is casked_ and all is cool_ then the great hatchways are unsealed_ the bowels of the ship are thrown open_ and down go the casks to their final rest in the sea_ this done_ the hatches are replaced_ and hermetically closed_ like a closet walled up_ in the sperm fishery_ this is perhaps one of the most remarkable incidents in all the business of whaling_ one day the planks stream with freshets of blood and oil_ on the sacred quarter_deck enormous masses of the whale_s head are profanely piled_ great rusty casks lie about_ as in a brewery yard_ the smoke from the try_works has besooted all the bulwarks_ the mariners go about suffused with unctuousness_ the entire ship seems great leviathan himself_ while on all hands the din is deafening_ but a day or two after_ you look about you_ and prick your ears in this self_same ship_ and were it not for the tell_tale boats and

reason why the decks never look so white as just after what they call an affair of oil_ besides_ from the ashes of the burned scraps of the whale_ a potent lye is readily made_ and whenever any adhesiveness from the back of the whale remains clinging to the side_ that lye quickly exterminates it_ hands go diligently along the bulwarks_ and with buckets of water and rags restore them to their full tidiness_ the soot is brushed from the lower rigging_ all the numerous implements which have been in use are likewise faithfully cleansed and put away_ the great hatch is scrubbed and placed upon the try_works_ completely hiding the pots_ every cask is out of sight_ all tackles are coiled in unseen nooks_ and when by the combined and simultaneous industry of almost the entire ship_s company_

regular turns at either limit_ the binnacle and mainmast_ but in the multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been added how that sometimes in these walks_ when most plunged in his mood_ he was wont to pause in turn at each spot_ and stand there strangely eyeing the particular object before him_ when he halted before the binnacle_ with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the compass_ that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of his purpose_ and when resuming his walk he again paused before the mainmast_ then_ as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin there_ he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness_ only dashed with a certain wild longing_ if not hopefulness_ but one morning_ turning to pass the doubloon_ he seemed to be newly attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it_ as though now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them_ and some certain significance lurks in all things_ else all things are little worth_ and the round world itself but an empty cipher_ except to sell by the cartload_ as they do hills about boston_ to fill up some morass in the milky way_ now this doubloon was of purest_ virgin gold_ raked somewhere out of the heart of gorgeous hills_ whence_ east and west_ over golden sands_ the head_waters of many a pactolus flows_ and though now nailed amidst all the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes_ yet_ untouchable and immaculate to any foulness_ it still preserved its quito glow_ nor_ though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hands_ and through the livelong nights shrouded with thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach_ nevertheless every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last_ for it was set apart and sanctified to one awe_striking end_ and however wanton in their sailor ways_

the pequod_ of nantucket_ meets the samuel enderby_ of london_ _ship_ ahoy_ hast seen the white whale__ so cried ahab_ once more hailing a ship showing english colours_ bearing down under the stern_ trumpet to mouth_ the old man was standing in his hoisted quarter_boat_ his ivory leg plainly revealed to the stranger captain_ who was carelessly reclining in his own boat_s bow_ he was a darkly_tanned_ burly_ good_natured_ fine_looking man_ of sixty or thereabouts_ dressed in a spacious roundabout_ that hung round him in festoons of blue pilot_cloth_ and one empty arm of this jacket streamed behind him like the broidered arm of a hussar_s surcoat_ _hast seen the white whale__ _see you this__ and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it_ he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone_ terminating in a wooden head like a mallet_ _man my boat__ cried ahab_ impetuously_ and tossing about the oars near him__stand by to lower__ in less than a minute_ without quitting his little craft_ he and his crew were dropped to the water_ and were soon alongside of the stranger_ but here a curious difficulty presented itself_ in the excitement of the moment_ ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his own_ and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to the pequod_ and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moment_s warning_ now_ it is no very easy matter for anybody_except those who are almost hourly used to it_ like whalemen_to clamber up a ship_s side from a boat on the open sea_ for the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks_ and then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson_ so_ deprived of one leg_ and the strange ship of course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention_ ahab now found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again_ hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope to attain_ it has before been hinted_ perhaps_ that every little untoward circumstance that befell him_ and which indirectly sprang from his luckless mishap_ almost invariably irritated or exasperated ahab_ and in the present instance_ all this was heightened by the sight of the two officers of the strange ship_ leaning over the side_ by the perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there_ and swinging towards him a pair of tastefully_ornamented man_ropes_ for at first they did not seem to bethink them that a one_legged man must be too much of a cripple to use their sea bannisters_ but this awkwardness only lasted a minute_ because the strange captain_ observing at a glance how affairs stood_ cried out_ _i see_ i see__avast heaving there_ jump_ boys_ and swing over the cutting_tackle__ as good luck would have it_ they had had a whale alongside a day or two previous_ and the great tackles were still aloft_ and the massive curved blubber_hook_ now clean and dry_ was still attached to the end_ this was quickly lowered to ahab_ who at once comprehending it all_ slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook _it was like sitting in the fluke of an anchor_ or the crotch of an apple tree__ and then giving the word_ held himself fast_ and at the same time also helped to hoist his own weight_ by pulling hand_over_hand upon one of the running parts of the tackle_ soon he was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks_ and gently landed upon the capstan head_ with his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome_ the other captain advanced_ and ahab_ putting out his ivory leg_ and crossing the ivory arm _like two sword_fish blades_ cried out in his walrus way_ _aye_ aye_ hearty_ let us shake bones together__an arm and a leg__an arm that never can shrink_ d_ye see_ and a leg that never can run_ where did_st thou see the white whale__how long ago__ _the white whale__ said the englishman_ pointing his ivory arm towards the east_ and taking a rueful sight along it_ as if it had been a telescope_ _there i saw him_ on the line_ last season__ _and he took that arm off_ did he__ asked ahab_ now sliding down from the capstan_ and resting on the englishman_s shoulder_ as he did so_ _aye_ he was the cause of it_ at least_ and that leg_ too__ _spin me the yarn__ said ahab_ _how was it__ _it was the first time in my life that i ever cruised on the line__ began the englishman_ _i was ignorant of the white whale at that time_ well_ one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales_ and my boat fastened to one of them_ a regular circus horse he was_ too_ that went milling and milling round so_ that my boat_s crew could only trim dish_ by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale_ presently up breaches from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale_ with a milky_white head and hump_ all crows_ feet and wrinkles__ _it was he_ it was he__ cried ahab_ suddenly letting out his suspended breath_ _and harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin__ _aye_ aye_they were mine_my irons__ cried ahab_ exultingly__but on__ _give me a chance_ then__ said the englishman_ good_humoredly_ _well_ this old great_grandfather_ with the white head and hump_ runs all afoam into the pod_ and goes to snapping furiously at my fast_line_ _aye_ i see__wanted to part it_ free the fast_fish_an old trick_i know him__ _how it was exactly__ continued the one_armed commander_ _i do not know_ but in biting the line_ it got foul of his teeth_ caught there somehow_ but we didn_t know it then_ so that when we afterwards pulled on the line_ bounce we came plump on to his hump_ instead of the other whale_s_ that went off to windward_ all fluking_ seeing how matters stood_ and what a noble great whale it was_the noblest and biggest i ever saw_ sir_ in my life_i resolved to capture him_ spite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in_ and thinking the hap_hazard line would get loose_ or the tooth it was tangled to might draw _for i have a devil of a

alive_ man_the next instant_ in a jiff_ i was blind as a bat_both eyes out_all befogged and bedeadened with black foam_the whale_s tail looming straight up out of it_ perpendicular in the air_ like a marble steeple_ no use sterning all_ then_ but as i was groping at midday_ with a blinding sun_ all crown_jewels_ as i was groping_ i say_ after the second iron_ to toss it overboard_down comes the tail like a lima tower_ cutting my boat in two_ leaving each half in splinters_ and_ flukes first_ the white hump backed through the wreck_ as though it was all chips_ we all struck out_ to escape his terrible flailings_ i seized hold of my harpoon_pole sticking in him_ and for a moment clung to that like a sucking fish_ but a combing sea dashed me off_ and at the same instant_ the fish_ taking one good dart forwards_ went down like a flash_ and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near me caught me here_ _clapping his hand just below his shoulder__ _yes_ caught me just here_ i say_ and bore me down to hell_s flames_ i was thinking_ when_ when_ all of a sudden_ thank the good god_ the barb ript its way along the flesh_clear along the whole length of my arm_came out nigh my wrist_

some time_ in fact_ as i before hinted_ i didn_t then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick_ till some time afterwards_ when coming back to the line_ we heard about moby dick_as some

i_m thinking moby dick doesn_t bite so much as he swallows__ _well_ then__ interrupted bunger_ _give him your left arm for bait to get the right_ do you know_ gentlemen__very gravely and mathematically bowing to each captain in succession__do you know_ gentlemen_ that the digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by divine providence_ that it is quite impossible for him to completely digest even a man_s arm_ and he knows it too_ so that what you take for the white whale_s malice is only his awkwardness_ for he never means to swallow a single limb_ he only thinks to terrify by feints_ but sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow_ formerly a patient of mine in ceylon_ that making believe swallow jack_knives_ once upon a time let one drop into him in good earnest_ and there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more_ when i gave him an emetic_ and he heaved it up in small tacks_ d_ye see_ no possible way for him to digest that jack_knife_ and fully incorporate it into his general bodily system_ yes_ captain boomer_ if you are quick enough about it_ and have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent burial to the other_ why in that case the arm is yours_ only let the whale have another chance at you shortly_ that_s all__ _no_ thank ye_ bunger__ said the english captain_ _he_s welcome to the arm he has_ since i

precious sperm_ the amelia_s example was soon followed by other ships_ english and american_ and thus the vast sperm whale grounds of the pacific were thrown open_ but not content with this good deed_ the indefatigable house again bestirred itself_ samuel and all his sons_how many_ their mother only knows_and under their immediate auspices_ and partly_ i think_ at their expense_ the british government was induced to send the sloop_of_war rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the south sea_ commanded by a naval post_captain_ the rattler made a rattling voyage of it_ and did some service_ how much does not appear_ but this is not all_ in _____ the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship of their own_ to go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of japan_ that ship_well called the _syren__made a noble experimental cruise_ and it was thus that the great japanese whaling ground first became generally known_ the syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a captain coffin_ a nantucketer_ all honour to the enderbies_ therefore_ whose house_ i think_ exists to the present day_ though doubtless the original samuel must long ago have slipped his cable for the great south sea of the other world_ the ship named after him was worthy of the honour_ being a very fast sailer and a noble craft every way_ i boarded her once at midnight somewhere off the patagonian coast_ and drank good flip down in the forecastle_ it was a fine gam we had_ and they were all trumps_every soul on board_ a short life to them_ and a jolly death_ and that fine gam i had_long_ very long after old ahab touched her planks with his ivory heel_it minds me of the noble_ solid_ saxon hospitality of that ship_ and may my parson forget me_ and the devil remember me_ if i ever lose sight of it_ flip_ did i say we had flip_ yes_ and we flipped it at the rate of ten gallons the hour_ and when the squall came _for it_s squally off there by patagonia__ and all hands_visitors and all_were called to reef topsails_ we were so top_heavy that we had to swing each other aloft in bowlines_ and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our jackets into the sails_ so that we hung there_ reefed fast in the howling gale_ a warning example to all drunken tars_ however_ the masts did not go overboard_ and by and by we scrambled down_ so sober_ that we had to pass the flip again_ though the savage salt spray bursting down the forecastle scuttle_ rather too much diluted and pickled it to my taste_ the beef was fine_tough_ but with body in it_ they said it was bull_beef_ others_ that it was dromedary beef_ but i do not know_ for certain_ how that was_ they had dumplings too_ small_ but substantial_ symmetrically globular_ and indestructible dumplings_ i fancied that you could feel them_ and roll them about in you after they were swallowed_ if you stooped over too far forward_ you risked their pitching out of you like billiard_balls_ the bread_but that couldn_t be helped_ besides_ it was an anti_scorbutic_ in short_ the bread contained the only fresh fare they had_ but the forecastle was not very light_ and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner when you ate it_ but all in all_ taking her from truck to helm_ considering the dimensions of the cook_s boilers_ including his own live parchment boilers_ fore and aft_ i say_ the samuel enderby was a jolly ship_ of good fare and plenty_ fine flip and strong_ crack fellows all_ and capital from boot heels to hat_band_ but why was it_ think ye_ that the samuel enderby_ and some other english whalers i know of_not all though_were such famous_ hospitable ships_ that passed round the beef_ and the bread_ and the can_ and the joke_ and were not soon weary of eating_ and drinking_ and laughing_ i will tell you_ the abounding good cheer of these english whalers is matter for historical research_ nor have i been at all sparing of historical whale research_ when it has seemed needed_ the english were preceded in the whale fishery by the hollanders_ zealanders_ and danes_ from whom they derived many terms still extant in the fishery_ and what is yet more_ their fat old fashions_ touching plenty to eat and drink_ for_ as a general thing_ the english merchant_ship scrimps her crew_ but not so the english whaler_ hence_ in the english_ this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and natural_ but incidental and particular_ and_ therefore_ must have some special origin_ which is here pointed out_ and will be still further elucidated_ during my researches in the leviathanic histories_ i stumbled upon an ancient dutch volume_ which_ by the musty whaling smell of it_ i knew must be about whalers_ the title was_ _dan coopman__ wherefore i concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some amsterdam cooper in the fishery_ as every whale ship must carry its cooper_ i was reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one _fitz swackhammer__ but my friend dr_ snodhead_ a very learned man_ professor of low dutch and high german in the college of santa claus and st_ pott_s_ to whom i handed the work for translation_ giving him a box of sperm candles for his trouble_this same dr_ snodhead_ so soon as he spied the book_ assured me that _dan coopman_ did not mean _the cooper__ but _the merchant__ in short_ this ancient and learned low dutch book treated of the commerce of holland_ and_ among other subjects_ contained a very interesting account of its whale fishery_ and in this chapter it was_ headed_ _smeer__ or _fat__ that i found a long detailed list of the outfits for the larders and cellars of ___ sail of dutch whalemen_ from which list_ as translated by dr_ snodhead_ i transcribe the following_ _______ lbs_ of beef_ ______ lbs_ friesland pork_ _______ lbs_ of stock fish_ _______ lbs_ of biscuit_ ______ lbs_ of soft bread_ _____ firkins of butter_ ______ lbs_ texel _ leyden cheese_ _______ lbs_ cheese _probably an inferior article__ ___ ankers of geneva_ ______ barrels of beer_ most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading_ not so in the present case_ however_ where the reader is flooded with whole pipes_ barrels_ quarts_ and gills of good gin and good cheer_ at the time_ i devoted three days to the studious digesting of all this beer_ beef_ and bread_ during which many profound thoughts were incidentally suggested to me_ capable of a transcendental and platonic application_ and_ furthermore_ i compiled supplementary tables of my own_ touching the probable quantity of stock_fish_ etc__ consumed by every low dutch harpooneer in that ancient greenland and spitzbergen whale fishery_ in the first place_ the amount of butter_ and texel and leyden cheese consumed_ seems amazing_ i impute it_ though_ to their naturally unctuous natures_ being rendered still more unctuous by the nature of their vocation_ and especially by their pursuing their game in those frigid polar seas_ on the very coasts of that esquimaux country where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil_ the quantity of beer_ too_ is very large_ ______ barrels_ now_ as those polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that climate_ so that the whole cruise of one of these dutch whalemen_ including the short voyage to and from the spitzbergen sea_ did not much exceed three months_ say_ and reckoning __ men to each of their fleet of ___ sail_ we have _____ low dutch seamen in all_ therefore_ i say_ we have precisely two barrels of beer per man_ for a twelve weeks_ allowance_ exclusive of his fair proportion of that ___ ankers of gin_ now_ whether these gin and beer harpooneers_ so fuddled as one might fancy them to have been_ were the right sort of men to stand up in a boat_s head_ and take good aim at flying whales_ this would seem somewhat improbable_ yet they did aim at them_ and hit them too_ but this was very far north_ be it remembered_ where beer agrees well with the constitution_ upon the equator_ in our southern fishery_ beer would be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast_head and boozy in his boat_ and grievous loss might ensue to nantucket and new bedford_ but no more_ enough has been said to show that the old dutch whalers of two or three centuries ago were high livers_ and that the english whalers have not neglected so excellent an example_ for_ say they_ when cruising in an empty ship_ if you can get nothing better out of the world_ get a good dinner out of it_ at least_ and this empties the decanter_ chapter ____ a bower in the arsacides_ hitherto_ in descriptively treating of the sperm whale_ i have chiefly dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect_ or separately and in detail upon some few interior structural features_ but to a large and thorough sweeping comprehension of him_ it behooves me now to unbutton him still further_ and untagging the points of his hose_ unbuckling his garters_ and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost bones_ set him before you in his ultimatum_ that is to say_ in his unconditional skeleton_ but how now_ ishmael_ how is it_ that you_ a mere oarsman in the fishery_ pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the whale_ did erudite stubb_ mounted upon your capstan_ deliver lectures on the anatomy of the cetacea_ and by help of the windlass_ hold up a specimen rib for exhibition_ explain thyself_ ishmael_ can you land a full_grown whale on your deck for examination_ as a cook dishes a roast_pig_ surely not_ a veritable witness have you hitherto been_ ishmael_ but have a care how you seize the privilege of jonah alone_ the privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams_ the rafters_ ridge_pole_ sleepers_ and under_pinnings_ making up the frame_work of leviathan_ and belike of the tallow_vats_ dairy_rooms_ butteries_ and cheeseries in his bowels_ i confess_ that since jonah_ few whalemen have penetrated very far beneath the skin of the adult whale_ nevertheless_ i have been blessed with an opportunity to dissect him in miniature_ in a ship i belonged to_ a small cub sperm whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for his poke or bag_ to make sheaths for the barbs of the harpoons_ and for the heads of the lances_ think you i let that chance go_ without using my boat_hatchet and jack_knife_ and breaking the seal and reading all the contents of that young cub_ and as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their gigantic_ full grown development_ for that rare knowledge i am indebted to my late royal friend tranquo_ king of tranque_ one of the arsacides_ for being at tranque_ years ago_ when attached to the trading_ship dey of algiers_ i was invited to spend part of the arsacidean holidays with the lord of tranque_ at his retired palm villa at pupella_ a sea_side glen not very far distant from what our sailors called bamboo_town_ his capital_ among many other fine qualities_ my royal friend tranquo_ being gifted with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu_ had brought together in pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious of his people could invent_ chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices_ chiselled shells_ inlaid spears_ costly paddles_ aromatic canoes_ and all these distributed among whatever natural wonders_ the wonder_freighted_ tribute_rendering waves had cast upon his shores_ chief among these latter was a great sperm whale_ which_ after an unusually long raging gale_ had been found dead and stranded_ with his head against a cocoa_nut tree_ whose plumage_like_ tufted droopings seemed his verdant jet_ when the vast body had at last been stripped of its fathom_deep enfoldings_ and the bones become dust dry in the sun_ then the skeleton was carefully transported up the pupella glen_ where a grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered it_ the ribs were hung with trophies_ the vertebrae were carved with arsacidean annals_ in strange hieroglyphics_ in the skull_ the priests kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame_ so that the mystic head again sent forth its vapoury spout_ while_ suspended from a bough_ the terrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees_ like the hair_hung sword that so affrighted damocles_ it was a wondrous sight_ the wood was green as mosses of the icy glen_ the trees stood high and haughty_ feeling their living sap_ the industrious earth beneath was as a weaver_s loom_ with a gorgeous carpet on it_ whereof the ground_vine tendrils formed the warp and woof_ and the living flowers the figures_ all the trees_ with all their laden branches_ all the shrubs_ and ferns_ and grasses_ the message_carrying air_ all these unceasingly were active_ through the lacings of the leaves_ the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied verdure_ oh_ busy weaver_ unseen weaver__pause__one word__whither flows the fabric_ what palace may it deck_ wherefore all these ceaseless toilings_ speak_ weaver__stay thy hand__but one single word with thee_ nay_the shuttle flies_the figures float from forth the loom_ the freshet_rushing carpet for ever slides away_ the weaver_god_ he weaves_ and by that weaving is he deafened_ that he hears no mortal voice_ and by that humming_ we_ too_ who look on the loom are deafened_ and only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak through it_ for even so it is in all material factories_ the spoken words that are inaudible among the flying spindles_ those same words are plainly heard without the walls_ bursting from the opened casements_ thereby have villainies been detected_ ah_ mortal_ then_ be heedful_ for so_ in all this din of the great world_s loom_ thy subtlest thinkings may be overheard afar_ now_ amid the green_ life_restless loom of that arsacidean wood_ the great_ white_ worshipped skeleton lay lounging_a gigantic idler_ yet_ as the ever_woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around him_ the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver_ himself all woven over with the vines_ every month assuming greener_ fresher verdure_ but himself a skeleton_ life folded death_ death trellised life_ the grim god wived with youthful life_ and begat him curly_headed glories_ now_ when with royal tranquo i visited this wondrous whale_ and saw the skull an altar_ and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real jet had issued_ i marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an object of vertu_ he laughed_ but more i marvelled that the priests should swear that smoky jet of his was genuine_ to and fro i paced before this skeleton_brushed the vines aside_broke through the ribs_and with a ball of arsacidean twine_ wandered_ eddied long amid its many winding_ shaded colonnades and arbours_ but soon my line was out_ and following it back_ i emerged from the opening where i entered_ i saw no living thing within_ naught was there but bones_ cutting me a green measuring_rod_ i once more dived within the skeleton_ from their arrow_slit in the skull_ the priests perceived me taking the altitude of the final rib_ _how now__ they shouted_ _dar_st thou measure this our god_ that_s for us__ _aye_ priests_well_ how long do ye make him_ then__ but hereupon a fierce contest rose among them_ concerning feet and inches_ they cracked each other_s sconces with their yard_sticks_the great skull echoed_and seizing that lucky chance_ i quickly concluded my own admeasurements_ these admeasurements i now propose to set before you_ but first_ be it recorded_ that_ in this matter_ i am not free to utter any fancied measurement i please_ because there are skeleton authorities you can refer to_ to test my accuracy_ there is a leviathanic museum_ they tell me_ in hull_ england_ one of the whaling ports of that country_ where they have some fine specimens of fin_backs and other whales_ likewise_ i have heard that in the museum of manchester_ in new hampshire_ they have what the proprietors call _the only perfect specimen of a greenland or river whale in the united states__ moreover_ at a place in yorkshire_ england_ burton constable by name_ a certain sir clifford constable has in his possession the skeleton of a sperm whale_ but of moderate size_ by no means of the full_grown magnitude of my friend king tranquo_s_ in both cases_ the stranded whales to which these two skeletons belonged_ were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar grounds_ king tranquo seizing his because he wanted it_ and sir clifford_ because he was lord of the seignories of those parts_ sir clifford_s whale has been articulated throughout_ so that_ like a great chest of drawers_ you can open and shut him_ in all his bony cavities_spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan_and swing all day upon his lower jaw_ locks are to be put upon some of his trap_doors and shutters_ and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of keys at his side_ sir clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep at the whispering gallery in the spinal column_ threepence to hear the echo in the hollow of his cerebellum_ and sixpence for the unrivalled view from his forehead_ the skeleton dimensions i shall now proceed to set down are copied verbatim from my right arm_ where i had them tattooed_ as in my wild wanderings at that period_ there was no other secure way of preserving such valuable statistics_ but as i was crowded for space_ and wished the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem i was then composing_at least_ what untattooed parts might remain_i did not trouble myself with the odd inches_ nor_ indeed_ should inches at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale_ chapter ____ measurement of the whale_s skeleton_ in the first place_ i wish to lay before you a particular_ plain statement_ touching the living bulk of this leviathan_ whose skeleton we are briefly to exhibit_ such a statement may prove useful here_ according to a careful calculation i have made_ and which i partly base upon captain scoresby_s estimate_ of seventy tons for the largest sized greenland whale of sixty feet in length_ according to my careful calculation_ i say_ a sperm whale of the largest magnitude_ between eighty_five and ninety feet in length_ and something less than forty feet in its fullest circumference_ such a whale will weigh at least ninety tons_ so that_ reckoning thirteen men to a ton_ he would considerably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one thousand one hundred inhabitants_ think you not then that brains_ like yoked cattle_ should be put to this leviathan_ to make him at all budge to any landsman_s imagination_ having already in various ways put before you his skull_ spout_hole_ jaw_ teeth_ tail_ forehead_ fins_ and divers other parts_ i shall now simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his unobstructed bones_ but as the colossal skull embraces so very large a proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton_ as it is by far the most complicated part_ and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it in this chapter_ you must not fail to carry it in your mind_ or under your arm_ as we proceed_ otherwise you will not gain a complete notion of the general structure we are about to view_ in length_ the sperm whale_s skeleton at tranque measured seventy_two feet_ so that when fully invested and extended in life_ he must have been ninety feet long_ for in the whale_ the skeleton loses about one fifth in length compared with the living body_ of this seventy_two feet_ his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet_ leaving some fifty feet of plain back_bone_ attached to this back_bone_ for something less than a third of its length_ was the mighty circular basket of ribs which once enclosed his vitals_ to me this vast ivory_ribbed chest_ with the long_ unrelieved spine_ extending far away from it in a straight line_ not a little resembled the hull of a great ship new_laid upon the stocks_ when only some twenty of her naked bow_ribs are inserted_ and the keel is otherwise_ for the time_ but a long_ disconnected timber_ the ribs were ten on a side_ the first_ to begin from the neck_ was nearly six feet long_ the second_ third_ and fourth were each successively longer_ till you came to the climax of the fifth_ or one of the middle ribs_ which measured eight feet and some inches_ from that part_ the remaining ribs diminished_ till the tenth and last only spanned five feet and some inches_ in general thickness_ they all bore a seemly correspondence to their length_ the middle ribs were the most arched_ in some of the arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay footpath bridges over small streams_ in considering these ribs_ i could not but be struck anew with the circumstance_ so variously repeated in this book_ that the skeleton of the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form_ the largest of the tranque ribs_ one of the middle ones_ occupied that part of the fish which_ in life_ is greatest in depth_ now_ the greatest depth of the invested body of this particular whale must have been at least sixteen feet_ whereas_ the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight feet_ so that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion of the living magnitude of that part_ besides_ for some way_ where i now saw but a naked spine_ all that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in flesh_ muscle_ blood_ and bowels_ still more_ for the ample fins_ i here saw but a few disordered joints_ and in place of the weighty and majestic_ but boneless flukes_ an utter blank_ how vain and foolish_ then_ thought i_ for timid untravelled man to try to comprehend aright this wondrous whale_ by merely poring over his dead attenuated skeleton_ stretched in this peaceful wood_ no_ only in the heart of quickest perils_ only when within the eddyings of his angry flukes_ only on the profound unbounded sea_ can the fully invested whale be truly and livingly found out_ but the spine_ for that_ the best way we can consider it is_ with a crane_ to pile its bones high up on end_ no speedy enterprise_ but now it_s done_ it looks much like pompey_s pillar_ there are forty and odd vertebrae in all_ which in the skeleton are not locked together_ they mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a gothic spire_ forming solid courses of heavy masonry_ the largest_ a middle one_ is in width something less than three feet_ and in depth more than four_ the smallest_ where the spine tapers away into the tail_ is only two inches in width_ and looks something like a white billiard_ball_ i was told that there were still smaller ones_ but they had been lost by some little cannibal urchins_ the priest_s children_ who had stolen them to play marbles with_ thus we see how that the spine of even the hugest of living things tapers off at last into simple child_s play_ chapter ____ the fossil whale_ from his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon to enlarge_ amplify_ and generally expatiate_ would you_ you could not compress him_ by good rights he should only be treated of in imperial folio_ not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail_ and the yards he measures about the waist_ only think of the gigantic involutions of his intestines_ where they lie in him like great cables and hawsers coiled away in the subterranean orlop_deck of a line_of_battle_ship_ since i have undertaken to manhandle this leviathan_ it behooves me to approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise_ not overlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood_ and spinning him out to the uttermost coil of his bowels_ having already described him in most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities_ it now remains to magnify him in an archaeological_ fossiliferous_ and antediluvian point of view_ applied to any other creature than the leviathan_to an ant or a flea_such portly terms might justly be deemed unwarrantably grandiloquent_ but when leviathan is the text_ the case is altered_ fain am i to stagger to this emprise under the weightiest words of the dictionary_ and here be it said_ that whenever it has been convenient to consult one in the course of these dissertations_ i have invariably used a huge quarto edition of johnson_ expressly purchased for that purpose_ because that famous lexicographer_s uncommon personal bulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale author like me_ one often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject_ though it may seem but an ordinary one_ how_ then_ with me_ writing of this leviathan_ unconsciously my chirography expands into placard capitals_ give me a condor_s quill_ give me vesuvius_ crater for an inkstand_ friends_ hold my arms_ for in the mere act of penning my thoughts of this leviathan_ they weary me_ and make me faint with their outreaching comprehensiveness of sweep_ as if to include the whole circle of the sciences_ and all the generations of whales_ and men_ and mastodons_ past_ present_ and to come_ with all the revolving panoramas of empire on earth_ and throughout the whole universe_ not excluding its suburbs_ such_ and so magnifying_ is the virtue of a large and liberal theme_ we expand to its bulk_ to produce a mighty book_ you must choose a mighty theme_ no great and enduring volume can ever be written on the flea_ though many there be who have tried it_ ere entering upon the subject of fossil whales_ i present my credentials as a geologist_ by stating that in my miscellaneous time i have been a stone_mason_ and also a great digger of ditches_ canals and wells_ wine_vaults_ cellars_ and cisterns of all sorts_ likewise_ by way of preliminary_ i desire to remind the reader_ that while in the earlier geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now almost completely extinct_ the subsequent relics discovered in what are called the tertiary formations seem the connecting_ or at any rate intercepted links_ between the antichronical creatures_ and those whose remote posterity are said to have entered the ark_ all the fossil whales hitherto discovered belong to the tertiary period_ which is the last preceding the superficial formations_ and though none of them precisely answer to any known species of the present time_ they are yet sufficiently akin to them in general respects_ to justify their taking rank as cetacean fossils_ detached broken fossils of pre_adamite whales_ fragments of their bones and skeletons_ have within thirty years past_ at various intervals_ been found at the base of the alps_ in lombardy_ in france_ in england_ in scotland_ and in the states of louisiana_ mississippi_ and alabama_ among the more curious of such remains is part of a skull_ which in the year ____ was disinterred in the rue dauphine in paris_ a short street opening almost directly upon the palace of the tuileries_ and bones disinterred in excavating the great docks of antwerp_ in napoleon_s time_ cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some utterly unknown leviathanic species_ but by far the most wonderful of all cetacean relics was the almost complete vast skeleton of an extinct monster_ found in the year _____ on the plantation of judge creagh_ in alabama_ the awe_stricken credulous slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the fallen angels_ the alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile_ and bestowed upon it the name of basilosaurus_ but some specimen bones of it being taken across the sea to owen_ the english anatomist_ it turned out that this alleged reptile was a whale_ though of a departed species_ a significant illustration of the fact_ again and again repeated in this book_ that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but little clue to the shape of his fully invested body_ so owen rechristened the monster zeuglodon_ and in his paper read before the london geological society_ pronounced it_ in substance_ one of the most extraordinary creatures which the mutations of the globe have blotted out of existence_ when i stand among these mighty leviathan skeletons_ skulls_ tusks_ jaws_ ribs_ and vertebrae_ all characterized by partial resemblances to the existing breeds of sea_monsters_ but at the same time bearing on the other hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical leviathans_ their incalculable seniors_ i am_ by a flood_ borne back to that wondrous period_ ere time itself can be said to have begun_ for time began with man_ here saturn_s grey chaos rolls over me_ and i obtain dim_ shuddering glimpses into those polar eternities_ when wedged bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the tropics_ and in all the ______ miles of this world_s circumference_ not an inhabitable hand_s breadth of land was visible_ then the whole world was the whale_s_ and_ king of creation_ he left his wake along the present lines of the andes and the himmalehs_ who can show a pedigree like leviathan_ ahab_s harpoon had shed older blood than the pharaoh_s_ methuselah seems a school_boy_ i look round to shake hands with shem_ i am horror_struck at this antemosaic_ unsourced existence of the unspeakable terrors of the whale_ which_ having been before all time_ must needs exist after all humane ages are over_ but not alone has this leviathan left his pre_adamite traces in the stereotype plates of nature_ and in limestone and marl bequeathed his ancient bust_ but upon egyptian tablets_ whose antiquity seems to claim for them an almost fossiliferous character_ we find the unmistakable print of his fin_ in an apartment of the great temple of denderah_ some fifty years ago_ there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a sculptured and painted planisphere_ abounding in centaurs_ griffins_ and dolphins_ similar to the grotesque figures on the celestial globe of the moderns_ gliding among them_ old leviathan swam as of yore_ was there swimming in that planisphere_ centuries before solomon was cradled_ nor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquity of the whale_ in his own osseous post_diluvian reality_ as set down by the venerable john leo_ the old barbary traveller_ _not far from the sea_side_ they have a temple_ the rafters and beams of which are made of whale_bones_ for whales of a monstrous size are oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore_ the common people imagine_ that by a secret power bestowed by god upon the temple_ no whale can pass it without immediate death_ but the truth of the matter is_ that on either side of the temple_ there are rocks that shoot two miles into the sea_ and wound the whales when they light upon _em_ they keep a whale_s rib of an incredible length for a miracle_ which lying upon the ground with its convex part uppermost_ makes an arch_ the head of which cannot be reached by a man upon a camel_s back_ this rib _says john leo_ is said to have layn there a hundred years before i saw it_ their historians affirm_ that a prophet who prophesy_d of mahomet_ came from this temple_ and some do not stand to assert_ that the prophet jonas was cast forth by the whale at the base of the temple__ in this afric temple of the whale i leave you_ reader_ and if you be a nantucketer_ and a whaleman_ you will silently worship there_ chapter ____ does the whale_s magnitude diminish__will he perish_ inasmuch_ then_ as this leviathan comes floundering down upon us from the head_waters of the eternities_ it may be fitly inquired_ whether_ in the long course of his generations_ he has not degenerated from the original bulk of his sires_ but upon investigation we find_ that not only are the whales of the present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are found in the tertiary system _embracing a distinct geological period prior to man__ but of the whales found in that tertiary system_ those belonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier ones_ of all the pre_adamite whales yet exhumed_ by far the largest is the alabama one mentioned in the last chapter_ and that was less than seventy feet in length in the skeleton_ whereas_ we have already seen_ that the tape_measure gives seventy_two feet for the skeleton of a large sized modern whale_ and i have heard_ on whalemen_s authority_ that sperm whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the time of capture_ but may it not be_ that while the whales of the present hour are an advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods_ may it not be_ that since adam_s time they have degenerated_ assuredly_ we must conclude so_ if we are to credit the accounts of such gentlemen as pliny_ and the ancient naturalists generally_ for pliny tells us of whales that embraced acres of living bulk_ and aldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet in length_rope walks and thames tunnels of whales_ and even in the days of banks and solander_ cooke_s naturalists_ we find a danish member of the academy of sciences setting down certain iceland whales _reydan_siskur_ or wrinkled bellies_ at one hundred and twenty yards_ that is_ three hundred and sixty feet_ and lacepede_ the french naturalist_ in his elaborate history of whales_ in the very beginning of his work _page ___ sets down the right whale at one hundred metres_ three hundred and twenty_eight feet_ and this work was published so late as a_d_ _____ but will any whaleman believe these stories_ no_ the whale of to_day is as big as his ancestors in pliny_s time_ and if ever i go where pliny is_ i_ a whaleman _more than he was__ will make bold to tell him so_ because i cannot understand how it is_ that while the egyptian mummies that were buried thousands of years before even pliny was born_ do not measure so much in their coffins as a modern kentuckian in his socks_ and while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest egyptian and nineveh tablets_ by the relative proportions in which they are drawn_ just as plainly prove that the high_bred_ stall_fed_ prize cattle of smithfield_ not only equal_ but far exceed in magnitude the fattest of pharaoh_s fat kine_ in the face of all this_ i will not admit that of all animals the whale alone should have degenerated_ but still another inquiry remains_ one often agitated by the more recondite nantucketers_ whether owing to the almost omniscient look_outs at the mast_heads of the whaleships_ now penetrating even through behring_s straits_ and into the remotest secret drawers and lockers of the world_ and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along all continental coasts_ the moot point is_ whether leviathan can long endure so wide a chase_ and so remorseless a havoc_ whether he must not at last be exterminated from the waters_ and the last whale_ like the last man_ smoke his last pipe_ and then himself evaporate in the final puff_ comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo_ which_ not forty years ago_ overspread by tens of thousands the prairies of illinois and missouri_ and shook their iron manes and scowled with their thunder_clotted brows upon the sites of populous river_capitals_ where now the polite broker sells you land at a dollar an inch_ in such a comparison an irresistible argument would seem furnished_ to show that the hunted whale cannot now escape speedy extinction_ but you must look at this matter in every light_ though so short a period ago_not a good lifetime_the census of the buffalo in illinois exceeded the census of men now in london_ and though at the present day not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region_ and though the cause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of man_ yet the far different nature of the whale_hunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious an end to the leviathan_ forty men in one ship hunting the sperm whales for forty_eight months think they have done extremely well_ and thank god_ if at last they carry home the oil of forty fish_ whereas_ in the days of the old canadian and indian hunters and trappers of the west_ when the far west _in whose sunset suns still rise_ was a wilderness and a virgin_ the same number of moccasined men_ for the same number of months_ mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships_ would have slain not forty_ but forty thousand and more buffaloes_ a fact that_ if need were_ could be statistically stated_ nor_ considered aright_ does it seem any argument in favour of the gradual extinction of the sperm whale_ for example_ that in former years _the latter part of the last century_ say_ these leviathans_ in small pods_ were encountered much oftener than at present_ and_ in consequence_ the voyages were not so prolonged_ and were also much more remunerative_ because_ as has been elsewhere noticed_ those whales_ influenced by some views to safety_ now swim the seas in immense caravans_ so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries_ yokes_ and pods_ and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but widely separated_ unfrequent armies_ that is all_ and equally fallacious seems the conceit_ that because the so_called whale_bone whales no longer haunt many grounds in former years abounding with them_ hence that species also is declining_ for they are only being driven from promontory to cape_ and if one coast is no longer enlivened with their jets_ then_ be sure_ some other and remoter strand has been very recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle_ furthermore_ concerning these last mentioned leviathans_ they have two firm fortresses_ which_ in all human probability_ will for ever remain impregnable_ and as upon the invasion of their valleys_ the frosty swiss have retreated to their mountains_ so_ hunted from the savannas and glades of the middle seas_ the whale_bone whales can at last resort to their polar citadels_ and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers and walls there_ come up among icy fields and floes_ and in a charmed circle of everlasting december_ bid defiance to all pursuit from man_ but as perhaps fifty of these whale_bone whales are harpooned for one cachalot_ some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions_ but though for some time past a number of these whales_ not less than _______ have been annually slain on the nor__west coast by the americans alone_ yet there are considerations which render even this circumstance of little or no account as an opposing argument in this matter_ natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness of the more enormous creatures of the globe_ yet what shall we say to harto_ the historian of goa_ when he tells us that at one hunting the king of siam took _____ elephants_ that in those regions elephants are numerous as droves of cattle in the temperate climes_ and there seems no reason to doubt that if these elephants_ which have now been hunted for thousands of years_ by semiramis_ by porus_ by hannibal_ and by all the successive monarchs of the east_if they still survive there in great numbers_ much more may the great whale outlast all hunting_ since he has a pasture to expatiate in_ which is precisely twice as large as all asia_ both americas_ europe and africa_ new holland_ and all the isles of the sea combined_ moreover_ we are to consider_ that from the presumed great longevity of whales_ their probably attaining the age of a century and more_ therefore at any one period of time_ several distinct adult generations must be contemporary_ and what that is_ we may soon gain some idea of_ by imagining all the grave_yards_ cemeteries_ and family vaults of creation yielding up the live bodies of all the men_ women_ and children who were alive seventy_five years ago_ and adding this countless host to the present human population of the globe_ wherefore_ for all these things_ we account the whale immortal in his species_ however perishable in his individuality_ he swam the seas before the continents broke water_ he once swam over the site of the tuileries_ and windsor castle_ and the kremlin_ in noah_s flood he despised noah_s ark_ and if ever the world is to be again flooded_ like the netherlands_ to kill off its rats_ then the eternal whale will still survive_ and rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorial flood_ spout his frothed defiance to the skies_ chapter ____ ahab_s leg_ the precipitating manner in which captain ahab had quitted the samuel enderby of london_ had not been unattended with some small violence to his own person_ he had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his boat that his ivory leg had received a half_splintering shock_ and when after gaining his own deck_ and his own pivot_hole there_ he so vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman _it was_ as ever_ something about his not steering inflexibly enough__ then_ the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist and wrench_ that though it still remained entire_ and to all appearances lusty_ yet ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy_ and_ indeed_ it seemed small matter for wonder_ that for all his pervading_ mad recklessness_ ahab did at times give careful heed to the condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood_ for it had not been very long prior to the pequod_s sailing from nantucket_ that he had been found one night lying prone upon the ground_ and insensible_ by some unknown_ and seemingly inexplicable_ unimaginable casualty_ his ivory limb having been so violently displaced_ that it had stake_wise smitten_ and all but pierced his groin_ nor was it without extreme difficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely cured_ nor_ at the time_ had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind_ that all the anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of a former woe_ and he too plainly seemed to see_ that as the most poisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as the sweetest songster of the grove_ so_ equally with every felicity_ all miserable events do naturally beget their like_ yea_ more than equally_ thought ahab_ since both the ancestry and posterity of grief go further than the ancestry and posterity of joy_ for_ not to hint of this_ that it is an inference from certain canonic teachings_ that while some natural enjoyments here shall have no children born to them for the other world_ but_ on the contrary_ shall be followed by the joy_childlessness of all hell_s despair_ whereas_ some guilty mortal miseries shall still fertilely beget to themselves an eternally progressive progeny of griefs beyond the grave_ not at all to hint of this_ there still seems an inequality in the deeper analysis of the thing_ for_ thought ahab_ while even the highest earthly felicities ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in them_ but_ at bottom_ all heartwoes_ a mystic significance_ and_ in some men_ an archangelic grandeur_ so do their diligent tracings_out not belie the obvious deduction_ to trail the genealogies of these high mortal miseries_ carries us at last among the sourceless primogenitures of the gods_ so that_ in the face of all the glad_ hay_making suns_ and soft cymballing_ round harvest_moons_ we must needs give in to this_ that the gods themselves are not for ever glad_ the ineffaceable_ sad birth_mark in the brow of man_ is but the stamp of sorrow in the signers_ unwittingly here a secret has been divulged_ which perhaps might more properly_ in set way_ have been disclosed before_ with many other particulars concerning ahab_ always had it remained a mystery to some_ why it was_ that for a certain period_ both before and after the sailing of the pequod_ he had hidden himself away with such grand_lama_like exclusiveness_ and_ for that one interval_ sought speechless refuge_ as it were_ among the marble senate of the dead_ captain peleg_s bruited reason for this thing appeared by no means adequate_ though_ indeed_ as touching all ahab_s deeper part_ every revelation partook more of significant darkness than of explanatory light_ but_ in the end_ it all came out_ this one matter did_ at least_ that direful mishap was at the bottom of his temporary recluseness_ and not only this_ but to that ever_contracting_ dropping circle ashore_ who_ for any reason_ possessed the privilege of a less banned approach to him_ to that timid circle the above hinted casualty_remaining_ as it did_ moodily unaccounted for by ahab_invested itself with terrors_ not entirely underived from the land of spirits and of wails_ so that_ through their zeal for him_ they had all conspired_ so far as in them lay_ to muffle up the knowledge of this thing from others_ and hence it was_ that not till a considerable interval had elapsed_ did it transpire upon the pequod_s decks_ but be all this as it may_ let the unseen_ ambiguous synod in the air_ or the vindictive princes and potentates of fire_ have to do or not with earthly ahab_ yet_ in this present matter of his leg_ he took plain practical procedures__he called the carpenter_ and when that functionary appeared before him_ he bade him without delay set about making a new leg_ and directed the mates to see him supplied with all the studs and joists of jaw_ivory _sperm whale_ which had thus far been accumulated on the voyage_ in order that a careful selection of the stoutest_ clearest_grained stuff might be secured_ this done_ the carpenter received orders to have the leg completed that night_ and to provide all the fittings for it_ independent of those pertaining to the distrusted one in use_ moreover_ the ship_s forge was ordered to be hoisted out of its temporary idleness in the hold_ and_ to accelerate the affair_ the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at once to the forging of whatever iron contrivances might be needed_ chapter ____ the carpenter_ seat thyself sultanically among the moons of saturn_ and take high abstracted man alone_ and he seems a wonder_ a grandeur_ and a woe_ but from the same point_ take mankind in mass_ and for the most part_ they seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates_ both contemporary and hereditary_ but most humble though he was_ and far from furnishing an example of the high_ humane abstraction_ the pequod_s carpenter was no duplicate_ hence_ he now comes in person on this stage_ like all sea_going ship carpenters_ and more especially those belonging to whaling vessels_ he was_ to a certain off_handed_ practical extent_ alike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own_ the carpenter_s pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of all those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with wood as an auxiliary material_ but_ besides the application to him of the generic remark above_ this carpenter of the pequod was singularly efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually recurring in a large ship_ upon a three or four years_ voyage_ in uncivilized and far_distant seas_ for not to speak of his readiness in ordinary duties__repairing stove boats_ sprung spars_ reforming the shape of clumsy_bladed oars_ inserting bull_s eyes in the deck_ or new tree_nails in the side planks_ and other miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to his special business_ he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes_ both useful and capricious_ the one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold_ was his vice_bench_ a long rude ponderous table furnished with several vices_ of different sizes_ and both of iron and of wood_ at all times except when whales were alongside_ this bench was securely lashed athwartships against the rear of the try_works_ a belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole_ the carpenter claps it into one of his ever_ready vices_ and straightway files it

vice_ the carpenter signs him to clap his jaw in that_ if he would have him draw the tooth_ thus_ this carpenter was prepared at all points_ and alike indifferent and without respect in all_ teeth he accounted bits of ivory_ heads he deemed but top_blocks_ men themselves he lightly held for capstans_ but while now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with such liveliness of expertness in him_ too_ all this would seem to argue some uncommon vivacity of intelligence_ but not precisely so_ for nothing was this man more remarkable_ than for a certain impersonal stolidity as it were_ impersonal_ i say_ for it so shaded off into the surrounding infinite of things_ that it seemed one with the general stolidity discernible in the whole visible world_ which while pauselessly active in uncounted modes_ still eternally holds its peace_ and ignores you_ though you dig foundations for cathedrals_ yet was this half_horrible stolidity in him_ involving_ too_ as it appeared_ an all_ramifying heartlessness__yet was it oddly dashed at times_ with an old_ crutch_like_ antediluvian_ wheezing humorousness_ not unstreaked now and then with a certain grizzled wittiness_ such as might have served to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle of noah_s ark_ was it that this old carpenter had been a life_long wanderer_ whose much rolling_ to and fro_ not only had gathered no moss_ but what is more_ had rubbed off whatever small outward clingings might have originally pertained to him_ he was a stript abstract_ an unfractioned integral_ uncompromised as a new_born babe_ living without premeditated reference to this world or the next_ you might almost say_ that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a sort of unintelligence_ for in his numerous trades_ he did not seem to work so much by reason or by instinct_ or simply because he had been tutored to it_ or by any intermixture of all these_ even or uneven_ but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb_ spontaneous literal process_ he was a pure manipulator_ his brain_ if he had ever had one_ must have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers_ he was like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful_ multum in parvo_ sheffield contrivances_ assuming the exterior_though a little swelled_of a common pocket knife_ but containing_ not only blades of various sizes_

part of him_ and the screw was fast_ or if for tweezers_ take him up by the legs_ and there they were_ yet_ as previously hinted_ this omnitooled_ open_and_shut carpenter_ was_ after all_ no mere machine of an automaton_ if he did not have a common soul in him_ he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously did its duty_ what that was_ whether essence of quicksilver_ or a few drops of hartshorn_ there is no telling_ but there it was_ and there it had abided for now some sixty years or more_ and this it was_ this same unaccountable_ cunning life_principle in him_ this it was_ that

in the little cabin_ but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed_ and returning the gun to the rack_ he went to the deck_ _thou art but too good a fellow_ starbuck__ he said lowly to the mate_ then raising his voice to the crew_ _furl the t_gallant_sails_ and close_reef the top_sails_ fore and aft_ back the main_yard_ up burton_ and break out in the main_hold__ it were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was_ that as respecting starbuck_ ahab thus acted_ it may have been a flash of honesty in him_ or mere prudential policy which_ under the circumstance_ imperiously forbade the

proved to him_ poor pagan_ where_ strange to say_ for all the heat of his sweatings_ he caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever_ and at last_ after some days_ suffering_ laid him in his hammock_ close to the very sill of the door of death_ how he wasted and wasted away in those few long_lingering days_ till there seemed but little left of him but his frame and tattooing_ but as all else in him thinned_ and his cheek_bones grew sharper_ his eyes_ nevertheless_ seemed growing fuller and fuller_ they became of a strange softness of lustre_ and mildly but deeply looked out at you there from his sickness_ a wondrous testimony to that immortal health in him which could not die_ or be weakened_ and like circles on the water_ which_ as they grow fainter_ expand_ so his eyes seemed rounding and rounding_ like the rings of eternity_ an awe that cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of this waning savage_ and saw as strange things in his face_ as any beheld who were bystanders when zoroaster died_ for whatever is truly wondrous and fearful in man_ never yet was put into words or books_ and the drawing near of death_ which alike levels all_ alike

mysterious shades you saw creeping over the face of poor queequeg_ as he quietly lay in his swaying hammock_ and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his final rest_ and the ocean_s invisible flood_tide lifted him higher and higher towards his destined heaven_ not a man of the crew but gave him up_ and_ as for queequeg himself_ what he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he asked_ he called one to him in the grey morning watch_ when the day was just breaking_ and taking his hand_ said that while in nantucket he had chanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood_ like the rich war_wood of his native isle_ and upon inquiry_ he had learned that all whalemen who died in nantucket_ were laid in those same dark canoes_ and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him_ for it was not unlike the custom of his own race_ who_ after embalming a dead warrior_ stretched him out in his canoe_ and so left him to be floated away to the starry archipelagoes_ for not only do they believe that the stars are isles_ but that far beyond all visible horizons_ their own mild_ uncontinented seas_ interflow with the blue heavens_ and so form the white breakers of the milky way_ he added_ that he shuddered at the thought of being buried in his hammock_ according to the usual sea_custom_ tossed like something vile to the death_devouring sharks_ no_ he desired a canoe like those of nantucket_ all the more congenial to him_ being a whaleman_ that like a whale_boat these coffin_canoes were without a keel_ though that involved but uncertain steering_ and much

coffin_coloured old lumber aboard_ which_ upon a long previous voyage_ had been cut from the aboriginal groves of the lackaday islands_ and from these dark planks the coffin was recommended to be made_ no sooner was the carpenter apprised of the order_ than taking his rule_ he forthwith with all the indifferent promptitude of his character_ proceeded into the forecastle and took queequeg_s

carpenter for convenience sake and general reference_ now transferringly measured on it the exact length the coffin was to be_ and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two notches at its extremities_ this done_ he marshalled the planks and his tools_ and to work_ when the last nail was driven_ and the lid duly planed and fitted_ he lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it_ inquiring whether they were ready for it yet in that direction_ overhearing the indignant but half_humorous cries with which the people on deck began to drive the coffin away_ queequeg_ to every one_s consternation_ commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to him_ nor was there any denying him_ seeing that_ of all mortals_ some dying men are the most tyrannical_ and certainly_ since they will shortly trouble us so little for evermore_ the poor fellows ought to be indulged_ leaning over in his hammock_ queequeg long regarded the coffin with an attentive eye_ he then called for his harpoon_ had the wooden stock drawn from it_ and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along with one of the paddles of his boat_ all by his own request_ also_ biscuits were then ranged round the sides within_ a flask of fresh water was placed at the head_ and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in the hold at the foot_ and a piece of sail_cloth being rolled up for a pillow_

_i have it_ it has happened before_ mr_ starbuck_ last night_s thunder turned our compasses_that_s all_ thou hast before now heard of such a thing_ i take it__ _aye_ but never before has it happened to me_ sir__ said the pale mate_ gloomily_ here_ it must needs be said_ that accidents like this have in more than one case occurred to ships in violent storms_ the magnetic energy_ as developed in the mariner_s needle_ is_ as all know_ essentially one with the electricity beheld in heaven_ hence it is not to be much marvelled at_ that such things should be_ instances where the lightning has actually struck the vessel_ so as to smite down some of the spars and rigging_ the effect upon the needle has at times been still more fatal_ all its loadstone virtue being annihilated_ so that the before magnetic steel was of no more use than an old wife_s knitting needle_ but in either case_ the needle never again_ of itself_ recovers the original virtue thus marred or lost_ and if the binnacle compasses be affected_ the same fate reaches all the others that may be in the ship_ even were the lowermost one inserted into the kelson_ deliberately standing before the binnacle_ and

juggling her_ meanwhile_ whatever were his own secret thoughts_ starbuck said nothing_ but quietly he issued all requisite orders_ while stubb and flask_who in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his feelings_likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced_ as for the men_ though some of them lowly rumbled_ their fear of ahab was greater than their fear of fate_ but as ever before_ the pagan harpooneers remained almost wholly unimpressed_ or if impressed_ it was only with a certain magnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible ahab_s_ for a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries_ but chancing to slip with his ivory heel_ he saw the crushed copper sight_tubes of the quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck_ _thou poor_ proud heaven_gazer and sun_s

smallest of the sail_maker_s needles_ quick__ accessory_ perhaps_ to the impulse dictating the thing he was now about to do_ were certain prudential motives_ whose object might have been to revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill_ in a matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses_ besides_ the old man well knew that to steer by transpointed needles_ though clumsily practicable_ was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious sailors_ without some shudderings and evil portents_ _men__ said he_ steadily turning upon the crew_ as the mate handed him the things he had demanded_ _my men_ the thunder turned old ahab_s needles_ but out of this bit of steel ahab can make one of his own_ that will point as true as any__ abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors_ as this was said_ and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic might follow_ but starbuck looked away_ with a blow from the top_maul ahab knocked off the steel head of the lance_ and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining_ bade him hold it upright_ without its touching the deck_ then_ with the maul_ after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod_ he placed the blunted needle endwise on the top of it_ and less strongly hammered that_ several times_ the mate still holding the rod as before_ then going through some small strange motions with it_whether indispensable to the magnetizing of the steel_ or merely intended to augment the awe of the crew_ is uncertain_he called for linen thread_ and moving to the binnacle_ slipped out the two reversed needles there_ and horizontally suspended the sail_needle by its middle_ over one of the compass_cards_ at first_ the steel went round and round_ quivering and vibrating at either end_ but at last it settled to its place_ when ahab_ who had been intently watching for this result_ stepped frankly back from the binnacle_ and pointing his stretched arm towards it_ exclaimed___look ye_ for yourselves_ if ahab be not lord of the level loadstone_ the sun is east_ and that compass swears it__ one after another they peered in_ for nothing but their own eyes could persuade such ignorance as theirs_ and one after another they slunk away_ in his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph_ you then saw ahab in all his fatal pride_ chapter ____ the log and line_ while now the fated pequod had been

long_ sideways impelled by unvarying trade winds_ over waves monotonously mild_ all these seemed the strange calm things preluding some riotous and desperate scene_ at last_ when the ship drew near to the outskirts_ as it were_ of the equatorial fishing_ground_ and in the deep darkness that goes before the dawn_ was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets_ the watch_then headed by flask_was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and unearthly_like half_articulated wailings of the ghosts of all herod_s murdered innocents_that one and all_ they started from their reveries_ and for the space of some moments stood_ or sat_ or leaned all transfixedly listening_ like the carved roman slave_ while that wild cry remained within hearing_ the christian or civilized part of the crew said it was mermaids_ and shuddered_ but the pagan harpooneers remained unappalled_ yet the grey manxman_the oldest mariner of all_declared that the wild thrilling sounds that were heard_ were the voices of newly drowned men in the sea_ below in his hammock_ ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn_ when he came to the deck_ it was then recounted to him by flask_ not unaccompanied with hinted dark meanings_ he hollowly laughed_ and thus explained the wonder_ those rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great numbers of seals_ and some young seals that had lost their dams_ or some dams that had lost their cubs_ must have risen nigh the ship and kept company with her_ crying and sobbing with their human sort of wail_ but this only the more affected some of them_ because most mariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals_ arising not only from their peculiar tones when in distress_ but also from the human look of their round heads and semi_intelligent faces_ seen peeringly uprising from the water alongside_ in the sea_ under certain circumstances_ seals have more than once been mistaken for men_ but the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible confirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning_ at sun_rise this man went from his hammock to his mast_head at the fore_ and whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep _for sailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state__ whether it was thus with the man_ there is now no telling_ but_ be that as it may_ he had not been long at his perch_ when a cry was heard_a cry

the stern_ where it always hung obedient to a cunning spring_ but no hand rose to seize it_ and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken_ so that it slowly filled_ and that parched wood also filled at its every pore_ and the studded iron_bound cask followed the sailor to the bottom_ as if to yield him his pillow_ though in sooth but a hard one_ and thus the first man of the pequod that mounted the mast to look out for the white whale_ on the white whale_s own peculiar ground_ that man was swallowed up in the deep_ but few_ perhaps_ thought of that at the time_ indeed_ in some sort_ they were not grieved at this event_ at least as a portent_ for they regarded it_ not as a foreshadowing of evil in the future_ but as the fulfilment of an evil already presaged_ they declared that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they had heard the night before_ but again the old manxman said nay_ the lost life_buoy was now to be replaced_ starbuck was directed to see to it_ but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found_ and as in the feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of the voyage_ all hands were impatient of any toil but what was directly

the missing boat_ kindling a fire in her try_pots for a beacon_ and every other man aloft on the look_out_ but though when she had thus sailed a sufficient distance to gain the presumed place of the absent ones when last seen_ though she then paused to lower her spare boats to pull all around her_ and not finding anything_ had again dashed on_ again paused_ and lowered her boats_ and though she had thus continued doing till daylight_ yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been seen_ the story told_ the stranger captain immediately went on to reveal his object in boarding the pequod_ he desired that ship to unite with his own in the search_ by sailing over the sea some four or five miles apart_ on parallel lines_ and so sweeping a double horizon_ as it were_ _i will wager something now__ whispered stubb to flask_ _that some one in that missing boat wore off that captain_s best coat_ mayhap_ his watch_he_s so cursed anxious to get it back_ who ever heard of two pious

standing behind them_ _i heard_ all of ye heard their spirits__ now_ as it shortly turned out_ what made this incident of the rachel_s the more melancholy_ was the circumstance_ that not only was one of the captain_s sons among the number of the missing boat_s crew_ but among the number of the other boat_s crews_ at the same time_ but on the other hand_ separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the chase_ there had been still another son_ as that for a time_ the wretched father was plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity_ which was only solved for him by his chief mate_s instinctively adopting the ordinary procedure of a whale_ship in such emergencies_ that is_ when placed between jeopardized but divided boats_ always to pick up the majority first_ but the captain_ for some unknown constitutional reason_ had refrained from mentioning all this_ and not till forced to it by ahab_s iciness did he allude to his one yet missing boy_ a little lad_ but twelve years old_ whose father with the earnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a nantucketer_s paternal love_ had thus early sought to initiate him in the perils and wonders of a vocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race_ nor does it unfrequently occur_ that nantucket captains will send a son of such tender age away from them_ for a protracted three or four years_ voyage in some other ship than their own_ so that their first knowledge of a whaleman_s career shall be unenervated by any chance display of a father_s natural but untimely partiality_ or undue apprehensiveness and concern_ meantime_ now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of ahab_ and ahab still stood like an anvil_ receiving every shock_ but without the least quivering of his own_ _i will not go__ said the stranger_ _till you say aye to me_ do to me as you would have me do to you in the like case_ for you too have a boy_ captain ahab_though but a child_ and nestling safely at home now_a child of your

minutes from this present instant warn off all strangers_ then brace forward again_ and let the ship sail as before__ hurriedly turning_ with averted face_ he descended into his cabin_ leaving the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utter rejection of his so earnest suit_ but starting from his enchantment_ gardiner silently hurried to the side_ more fell than stepped into his boat_ and returned to his ship_ soon the two ships diverged their wakes_ and long as the strange vessel was in view_ she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot_ however small_ on the sea_ this way and that her yards were swung round_ starboard and larboard_ she continued to tack_ now she beat against a head sea_ and again it pushed her before it_ while all the while_ her masts and yards were thickly clustered with men_ as three tall cherry trees_ when the boys are cherrying among the boughs_ but by her still halting course and winding_ woeful way_ you plainly saw that this ship

securely there_ now_ that he found himself hard by the very latitude and longitude where his tormenting wound had been inflicted_ now that a vessel had been spoken which on the very day preceding had actually encountered moby dick__and now that all his successive meetings with various ships contrastingly concurred to show the demoniac indifference with which the white whale tore his hunters_ whether sinning or sinned against_ now it was that there lurked a something in the old man_s eyes_ which it was hardly sufferable for feeble souls to see_ as the unsetting polar star_ which through the livelong_ arctic_ six months_ night sustains its piercing_ steady_ central gaze_ so ahab_s purpose now fixedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew_ it domineered above them so_ that all their bodings_ doubts_ misgivings_ fears_ were fain to hide beneath their souls_ and not sprout forth a single spear or leaf_ in this foreshadowing interval too_ all humor_ forced or natural_ vanished_ stubb no more strove to raise a smile_ starbuck no more strove to check one_ alike_ joy and sorrow_ hope and fear_ seemed ground to finest dust_ and powdered_ for the time_ in the clamped mortar of ahab_s iron soul_ like machines_ they dumbly moved about the deck_ ever conscious that the old man_s despot eye was on them_ but did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours_ when he thought no glance but one was on him_ then you would have seen that even as ahab_s eyes so awed the crew_s_ the inscrutable parsee_s glance awed his_ or somehow_ at least_ in some wild way_ at times affected it_ such an added_ gliding strangeness began to invest the thin fedallah now_ such ceaseless shudderings shook him_ that the men looked dubious at him_ half uncertain_ as it seemed_ whether indeed he were a mortal substance_ or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen being_s body_ and that shadow was always hovering there_ for not by night_ even_ had fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber_ or go below_ he would stand still for hours_ but never sat or leaned_ his wan but wondrous eyes did plainly say_we two watchmen never rest_ nor_ at any time_ by night or day could the mariners now step upon the deck_ unless ahab was before them_ either standing in his pivot_hole_ or exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limits__the main_mast and the mizen_ or else they saw him standing in the cabin_scuttle__his living foot advanced upon the deck_ as if to step_ his hat slouched heavily over his eyes_ so that however motionless he stood_ however the days and nights were added on_ that he had not swung in his hammock_ yet hidden beneath that slouching hat_ they could never tell unerringly whether_ for all this_ his eyes were really closed at times_ or whether he was still intently scanning them_ no matter_ though he stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch_ and the unheeded night_damp gathered in beads of dew upon that stone_carved coat and hat_ the clothes that the night had wet_ the next day_s sunshine dried upon him_ and so_ day after day_ and night after night_ he went no more beneath the planks_ whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for_ he ate in the same open air_ that is_ his two only meals__breakfast and dinner_ supper he never touched_ nor reaped his beard_ which darkly grew all gnarled_ as unearthed roots of trees blown over_ which still grow idly on at naked base_ though perished in the upper verdure_ but though his whole life was now become one watch on deck_ and though the parsee_s mystic watch was without intermission as his own_ yet these two never seemed to speak_one man to the other_unless at long intervals some passing unmomentous matter made it necessary_ though such a potent spell seemed secretly to join the twain_ openly_ and to the awe_struck crew_ they seemed pole_like asunder_ if by day they chanced to speak one word_ by night_ dumb men were both_ so far as concerned the slightest verbal interchange_ at times_ for longest hours_ without a single hail_ they stood far parted in the starlight_ ahab in his scuttle_ the parsee by the mainmast_ but still fixedly gazing upon each other_ as if in the parsee ahab saw his forethrown shadow_ in ahab the parsee his abandoned substance_ and yet_ somehow_ did ahab_in his own proper self_ as daily_ hourly_ and every instant_ commandingly revealed to his subordinates__ahab seemed an independent lord_ the parsee but his slave_ still again both seemed yoked together_ and an unseen tyrant driving them_ the lean shade siding the solid rib_ for be this parsee what he may_ all rib and keel was solid ahab_ at the first faintest glimmering of the dawn_ his iron voice was heard from aft___man the mast_heads___and all through the day_ till after sunset and after twilight_ the same voice every hour_ at the striking of the helmsman_s bell_ was heard__what d_ye see__sharp_ sharp__ but when three or four days had slided by_ after meeting the children_seeking rachel_ and no spout had yet been seen_ the monomaniac old man seemed distrustful of his crew_s fidelity_ at least_ of nearly all except the pagan harpooneers_ he seemed to doubt_ even_ whether stubb and flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought_ but if these suspicions were really his_ he sagaciously refrained from verbally expressing them_ however his actions might seem to hint them_ _i will have the first sight of the whale myself___he said_ _aye_ ahab must have the doubloon__ and with his own hands he rigged a nest of basketed bowlines_ and sending a hand aloft_ with a single sheaved block_ to secure to the main_mast head_ he received the two ends of the downward_reeved rope_ and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin for the other end_ in order to fasten it at the rail_ this done_ with that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin_ he looked round upon his crew_ sweeping from one to the other_ pausing his glance long upon daggoo_ queequeg_ tashtego_ but shunning fedallah_ and then settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate_ said___take the rope_ sir_i give it into thy hands_ starbuck__ then arranging his person in the basket_ he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch_ starbuck being the one who secured the rope at last_ and afterwards stood near it_ and thus_ with one hand clinging round the royal mast_ ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and miles__ahead_ astern_ this side_ and that__within the wide expanded circle commanded at so great a height_ when in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in the rigging_ which chances to afford no foothold_ the sailor at sea is hoisted up to that spot_ and sustained there by the rope_ under these circumstances_ its fastened end on deck is always given in strict charge to some one man who has the special watch of it_ because in such a wilderness of running rigging_ whose various different relations aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at the deck_ and when the deck_ends of these ropes are being every few minutes cast down from the fastenings_ it would be but a natural fatality_ if_ unprovided with a constant watchman_ the hoisted sailor should by some carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea_ so ahab_s proceedings in this matter were not unusual_ the only strange thing about them seemed to be_ that starbuck_ almost the one only man who had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree approaching to decision_one of those too_ whose faithfulness on the look_out he had seemed to doubt somewhat__it was strange_ that this was the very man he should select for his watchman_ freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise distrusted person_s hands_ now_ the first time ahab was perched aloft_ ere he had been there ten minutes_ one of those red_billed savage sea_hawks which so often fly incommodiously close round the manned mast_heads of whalemen in these latitudes_ one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings_ then it darted a thousand feet straight up into the air_ then spiralized downwards_ and went eddying again round his head_ but with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon_ ahab seemed not to mark this wild bird_ nor_ indeed_ would any one else have marked it much_ it being no uncommon circumstance_ only now almost the least heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every sight_ _your hat_ your hat_ sir__ suddenly cried the sicilian seaman_ who being posted at the mizen_mast_head_ stood directly behind ahab_ though somewhat lower than his level_ and with a deep gulf of air dividing them_ but already the sable wing was before the old man_s eyes_ the long hooked bill at his head_ with a scream_ the black hawk darted away with his prize_ an eagle flew thrice round tarquin_s head_ removing his cap to replace it_ and thereupon tanaquil_ his wife_ declared that tarquin would be king of rome_ but only by the replacing of the cap was that omen accounted good_ ahab_s hat was never restored_ the wild hawk flew on and on with it_ far in advance of the prow_ and at last disappeared_ while from the point of that disappearance_ a minute black spot was dimly discerned_ falling from that vast height into the sea_ chapter ____ the pequod meets the delight_ the intense pequod sailed on_ the rolling waves and days went by_ the life_buoy_coffin still lightly swung_ and another ship_ most miserably misnamed the delight_ was descried_ as she drew nigh_ all eyes were fixed upon her broad beams_ called shears_ which_ in some whaling_ships_ cross the quarter_deck at the height of eight or nine feet_ serving to carry the spare_ unrigged_ or disabled boats_ upon the stranger_s shears were beheld the shattered_ white ribs_ and some few splintered planks_ of what had once been a whale_boat_ but you now saw through this wreck_ as plainly as you see through the peeled_ half_unhinged_ and bleaching skeleton of a horse_ _hast seen the white whale__ _look__ replied the hollow_cheeked captain from his taffrail_ and with his trumpet he pointed to the wreck_ _hast killed him__ _the harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that__ answered the other_ sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck_ whose gathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together_ _not forged__ and snatching perth_s levelled iron from the crotch_ ahab held it out_ exclaiming__look ye_ nantucketer_ here in this hand i hold his death_ tempered in blood_ and tempered by lightning are these barbs_ and i swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the fin_ where the white whale most feels his accursed life__ _then god keep thee_ old man_see_st thou that__pointing to the hammock__i bury but one of five

lightning to his men_ but the suddenly started pequod was not quick enough to escape the sound of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea_ not so quick_ indeed_ but that some of the flying bubbles might have sprinkled her hull with their ghostly baptism_ as ahab now glided from the dejected delight_ the strange life_buoy hanging at the pequod_s stern came into conspicuous relief_

symphony_ it was a clear steel_blue day_ the firmaments of air and sea were hardly separable in that all_pervading azure_ only_ the pensive air was transparently pure and soft_ with a woman_s look_

the compass_ and then the dog_vane_ and then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as possible_ ahab rapidly ordered the ship_s course to be slightly altered_ and the sail to be shortened_ the acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated at daybreak_ by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and lengthwise ahead_ smooth as oil_ and resembling in the pleated watery wrinkles bordering it_ the polished metallic_like marks of some swift tide_rip_ at the mouth of a deep_ rapid stream_ _man the mast_heads_ call all hands__ thundering with the butts

length the breathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey_ that his entire dazzling hump was distinctly visible_ sliding along the sea as if an isolated thing_ and continually set in a revolving ring of finest_ fleecy_ greenish foam_ he saw the vast_ involved wrinkles of the slightly projecting head beyond_ before it_ far out on the soft turkish_rugged waters_ went the glistening white shadow from his broad_ milky forehead_ a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade_ and behind_ the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake_ and on either hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his side_ but these were broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea_ alternate with their fitful flight_ and like to some flag_staff rising from the painted hull of an argosy_ the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected from the white whale_s back_ and at intervals one of the cloud of soft_toed fowls hovering_ and to and fro skimming like a canopy over the fish_ silently perched and rocked on this pole_ the long tail feathers streaming like pennons_ a gentle joyousness_a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness_ invested the gliding whale_ not the white bull jupiter swimming away with ravished europa clinging to his graceful horns_ his lovely_ leering eyes sideways intent upon the maid_ with smooth bewitching fleetness_ rippling straight for the nuptial bower in crete_ not jove_ not that great majesty supreme_ did surpass the glorified white whale as he so divinely swam_ on each soft side_coincident with the parted swell_ that but once leaving him_ then flowed so wide away_on each bright side_ the whale shed off enticings_ no wonder there had been some among the hunters who namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity_ had ventured to assail it_ but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of tornadoes_ yet calm_ enticing calm_ oh_ whale_ thou glidest on_ to all who for the first time eye thee_ no matter how many in that same way thou may_st have bejuggled and destroyed before_ and thus_ through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea_ among waves whose hand_clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture_ moby dick moved on_ still withholding from sight the full terrors of his submerged trunk_ entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw_ but soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water_ for an instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch_ like virginia_s natural bridge_ and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air_ the grand god revealed himself_ sounded_ and went out of sight_ hoveringly halting_ and dipping on the wing_ the white sea_fowls longingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left_ with oars apeak_ and paddles down_ the sheets of their sails adrift_ the three boats now stilly floated_ awaiting moby dick_s reappearance_ _an hour__ said ahab_ standing rooted in his boat_s stern_ and he gazed beyond the whale_s place_ towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing vacancies to leeward_ it was only an instant_ for again his eyes seemed whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle_ the breeze now freshened_ the sea began to swell_ _the birds__the birds__ cried tashtego_ in long indian file_ as when herons take wing_ the white birds were now all flying towards ahab_s boat_ and when within a few yards began fluttering over the water there_ wheeling round and round_ with joyous_ expectant cries_ their vision was keener than man_s_ ahab could discover no sign in the sea_ but suddenly as he peered down and down into its depths_ he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a white weasel_ with wonderful celerity uprising_ and magnifying as it rose_ till it turned_ and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked rows of white_ glistening teeth_ floating up from the undiscoverable bottom_ it was moby dick_s open mouth and scrolled jaw_ his vast_ shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea_ the glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open_doored marble tomb_ and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar_ ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous apparition_ then_ calling upon fedallah to change places with him_ went forward to the bows_ and seizing perth_s harpoon_ commanded his crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern_ now_ by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis_ its bow_ by anticipation_ was made to face the whale_s head while yet under water_ but as if perceiving this stratagem_ moby dick_ with that malicious intelligence ascribed to him_ sidelingly transplanted himself_ as it were_ in an instant_ shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath the boat_ through and through_ through every plank and each rib_ it thrilled for an instant_ the whale obliquely lying on his back_ in the manner of a biting shark_ slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his mouth_ so that the long_ narrow_ scrolled lower jaw curled high up into the open air_ and one of the teeth caught in a row_lock_ the bluish pearl_white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of ahab_s head_ and reached higher than that_ in this attitude the white whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse_ with unastonished eyes fedallah gazed_ and crossed his arms_ but the tiger_yellow crew were tumbling over each other_s heads to gain the uttermost stern_ and now_ while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out_ as the whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way_ and from his body being submerged beneath the boat_ he could not be darted at from the bows_ for the bows were almost inside of him_ as it were_ and while the other boats involuntarily paused_ as before a quick crisis impossible to withstand_ then it was that monomaniac ahab_ furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe_ which placed him all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated_ frenzied with all this_ he seized the long bone with his naked hands_ and wildly strove to wrench it from its gripe_ as now he thus vainly strove_ the jaw slipped from him_ the frail gunwales bent in_ collapsed_ and snapped_ as both jaws_ like an enormous shears_ sliding further aft_ bit the craft completely in twain_ and locked themselves fast again in the sea_ midway between the two floating wrecks_ these floated aside_ the broken ends drooping_ the crew at the stern_wreck clinging to the gunwales_ and striving to hold fast to the oars to lash them across_ at that preluding moment_ ere the boat was yet snapped_ ahab_ the first to perceive the whale_s intent_ by the crafty upraising of his head_ a movement that loosed his hold for the time_ at that moment his hand had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite_ but only slipping further into the whale_s mouth_ and tilting over sideways as it slipped_ the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw_ spilled him out of it_ as he leaned to the push_ and so he fell flat_faced upon the sea_ ripplingly withdrawing from his prey_ moby dick now lay at a little distance_ vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the billows_ and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body_ so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose_some twenty or more feet out of the water_the now rising swells_ with all their confluent waves_ dazzlingly broke against it_ vindictively tossing their shivered spray still higher into the air__ so_ in a gale_ the but half baffled channel billows only recoil from the base of the eddystone_ triumphantly to overleap its summit with their scud_ _this motion is peculiar to the sperm whale_ it receives its designation _pitchpoling_ from its being likened to that preliminary up_and_down poise of the whale_lance_ in the exercise called pitchpoling_ previously described_ by this motion the whale must best and most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling him_ but soon resuming his horizontal attitude_ moby dick swam swiftly round and round the wrecked crew_ sideways churning the water in his vengeful wake_ as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault_ the sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him_ as the blood of grapes and mulberries cast before antiochus_s elephants in the book of maccabees_ meanwhile ahab half smothered in the foam of the whale_s insolent tail_ and too much of a cripple to swim__though he could still keep afloat_ even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that_ helpless ahab_s head was seen_ like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock might burst_ from the boat_s fragmentary stern_ fedallah incuriously and mildly eyed him_ the clinging crew_ at the other drifting end_ could not succor him_ more than enough was it for them to look to themselves_ for so revolvingly appalling was the white whale_s aspect_ and so planetarily swift the ever_contracting circles he made_ that he seemed horizontally swooping upon them_ and though the other boats_ unharmed_ still hovered hard by_ still they dared not pull into the eddy to strike_ lest that should be the signal for the instant destruction of the jeopardized castaways_ ahab and all_ nor in that case could they themselves hope to escape_ with straining eyes_ then_ they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone_ whose centre had now become the old man_s head_ meantime_ from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship_s mast heads_ and squaring her yards_ she had borne down upon the scene_ and was now so nigh_ that ahab in the water hailed her___sail on the__but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from moby dick_ and whelmed him for the time_ but

effectually parted the white whale from his victim_ as he sullenly swam off_ the boats flew to the rescue_ dragged into stubb_s boat with blood_shot_ blinded eyes_ the white brine caking in his wrinkles_ the long tension of ahab_s bodily strength did crack_ and helplessly he yielded to his body_s doom_ for a time_ lying all crushed in the bottom of stubb_s boat_ like one trodden under foot

boat is stove_ its crew_ being picked up by another boat_ help to work that second boat_ and the chase is thus continued with what is called double_banked oars_ it was thus now_ but the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the whale_ for he seemed to have treble_banked his every fin_ swimming with a velocity which plainly showed_ that if now_ under these circumstances_ pushed on_ the chase would prove an indefinitely prolonged_ if not a hopeless one_ nor could any crew endure for so long a period_ such an unintermitted_ intense straining at the oar_ a thing barely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude_ the ship itself_ then_ as it sometimes happens_ offered the most promising intermediate means of overtaking the chase_ accordingly_ the boats now made for

sail still higher_ or to spread one to a still greater breadth_thus to and fro pacing_ beneath his slouched hat_ at every turn he passed his own wrecked boat_ which had been dropped upon the quarter_deck_ and lay there reversed_ broken bow to shattered stern_ at last he paused before it_ and as in an already over_clouded sky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail across_ so over the old man_s face there now stole some such added gloom as this_ stubb saw him pause_ and perhaps intending_ not vainly_ though_ to evince his own unabated fortitude_ and thus keep up a valiant place in

he travels faster than i thought for__the top_gallant sails__aye_ they should have been kept on her all night_ but no matter__tis but resting for the rush__ here be it said_ that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale_ continued through day into night_ and through night into day_ is a thing by no means unprecedented in the south sea fishery_ for such is the wonderful skill_ prescience of experience_ and invincible confidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the nantucket commanders_ that from the simple observation of a whale when last descried_ they will_ under certain given circumstances_ pretty accurately foretell both the direction in which he will continue to swim for a time_ while out of sight_ as well as his probable rate of progression during that period_ and_ in these cases_ somewhat as a pilot_ when about losing sight of a coast_ whose general trending he well knows_ and which he desires shortly to return to again_ but at some further point_ like as this pilot stands by his compass_ and takes the precise bearing of the cape at present visible_ in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote_ unseen headland_ eventually to be visited_ so does the fisherman_ at his compass_ with the whale_ for after being chased_ and diligently marked_ through several hours of daylight_ then_ when night obscures the fish_ the creature_s future wake through the darkness is almost as established to the sagacious mind of the hunter_ as the pilot_s coast is to him_ so that to this hunter_s wondrous skill_ the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water_ a wake_ is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land_ and as the mighty iron leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly known in its every pace_ that_ with watches in their hands_ men time his rate as doctors that of a baby_s pulse_ and lightly say of it_ the up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot_ at such or such an hour_ even so_ almost_ there are occasions when these nantucketers time that other leviathan of the deep_ according to the observed humor of his speed_ and say to themselves_ so many hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles_ will have about reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude_ but to render this acuteness at all successful in the end_ the wind and the sea must be the whaleman_s allies_ for of what present avail to the becalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him he is exactly ninety_three leagues and a quarter from his port_ inferable from these statements_ are many collateral subtile matters touching the chase of whales_ the ship tore on_ leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a cannon_ball_ missent_ becomes a plough_share and turns up the level field_ _by salt and hemp__ cried stubb_ _but this swift motion of the deck creeps up one_s legs and tingles at the heart_ this ship and i are two brave fellows__ha_ ha_ some one take me up_ and launch me_ spine_wise_ on the sea__for by live_oaks_ my spine_s a keel_ ha_ ha_ we go the gait that leaves no dust behind__ _there she blows_she blows__she blows__right ahead__ was now the mast_head

a miller shuts his watergate upon the stream__ and stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew_ the frenzies of the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up_ like old wine worked anew_ whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might have felt before_ these were not only now kept out of sight through the growing awe of ahab_ but they were broken up_ and on all sides routed_ as timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison_ the hand of fate had snatched all their souls_ and by the stirring perils of the previous day_ the rack of the past night_s suspense_ the fixed_ unfearing_ blind_ reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging towards its flying mark_ by all these things_ their hearts were bowled along_ the wind that made great bellies of their sails_ and rushed the vessel on by arms invisible as irresistible_ this seemed the symbol of that unseen agency which so enslaved them to the race_ they were one man_ not thirty_ for as the one ship that held them all_ though it was put together of all contrasting things_oak_ and maple_ and pine wood_ iron_ and pitch_ and hemp_yet all these ran into each other in the one concrete hull_ which shot on its way_ both balanced and directed by the long central keel_ even so_ all the individualities of the crew_ this man_s valor_ that man_s fear_ guilt and guiltiness_ all varieties were welded into oneness_ and were all directed to that fatal goal which ahab their one lord and keel did point to_ the rigging lived_ the mast_heads_ like the tops of tall palms_ were outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs_ clinging to a spar with one hand_ some reached forth the other with impatient wavings_ others_ shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight_ sat far out on the rocking yards_ all the spars in full bearing of mortals_ ready and ripe for their fate_ ah_ how they still strove through that infinite blueness to seek out the thing that might destroy them_ _why sing ye not out for him_ if ye see him__ cried ahab_ when_ after the lapse of some minutes since the first cry_ no more had been heard_ _sway me up_ men_ ye have been deceived_ not moby dick casts one odd jet that way_ and then disappears__ it was even so_ in their headlong eagerness_ the men had mistaken some other thing for the whale_spout_ as the event itself soon proved_ for hardly had ahab reached his perch_ hardly was the rope belayed to its pin on deck_ when he struck the key_note to an orchestra_ that made the air vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles_ the triumphant halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard_ as_much nearer to the ship than the place of the imaginary jet_ less than a mile ahead_moby dick bodily burst into view_ for not by any calm and indolent spoutings_ not by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head_ did the white whale now reveal his vicinity_ but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of breaching_ rising with his utmost velocity from the furthest depths_ the sperm whale thus booms his entire bulk into the pure element of air_ and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam_ shows his place to the distance of seven miles and more_ in those moments_ the torn_ enraged waves he shakes off_ seem his mane_ in some cases_ this breaching is his act of defiance_ _there she breaches_ there she breaches__ was the cry_ as in his immeasurable bravadoes the white whale tossed himself salmon_like to heaven_ so suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea_ and relieved against the still bluer margin of the sky_ the spray that he raised_ for the moment_ intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier_ and stood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling intensity_ to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale_ _aye_ breach your last to the sun_ moby dick__ cried ahab_ _thy hour and thy harpoon are at hand__down_ down all of ye_ but one man at the fore_ the boats__stand by__ unmindful of the tedious rope_ladders of the shrouds_ the men_ like shooting stars_ slid to the deck_ by the isolated backstays and halyards_ while ahab_ less dartingly_ but still rapidly was dropped from his perch_ _lower away__ he cried_ so soon as he had reached his boat_a spare one_ rigged the afternoon previous_ _mr_ starbuck_ the ship is thine_keep away from the boats_ but keep near them_ lower_ all__ as if to strike a quick terror into them_ by this time being the first assailant himself_ moby dick had turned_ and was now coming for the three crews_ ahab_s boat was central_ and cheering his men_ he told them he would take the whale head_and_head__that is_ pull straight up to his forehead__a not uncommon thing_ for when within a certain limit_ such a course excludes the coming onset from the whale_s sidelong vision_ but ere that close limit was gained_ and while yet all three boats were plain as the ship_s three masts to his eye_ the white whale churning himself into furious speed_ almost in an instant as it were_ rushing among the boats with open jaws_ and a lashing tail_ offered appalling battle on every side_ and heedless of the irons darted at him from every boat_ seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank of which those boats were made_ but skilfully manoeuvred_ incessantly wheeling like trained chargers in the field_ the boats for a while eluded him_ though_ at times_ but by a plank_s breadth_ while all the time_ ahab_s unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds_ but at last in his untraceable evolutions_ the white whale so crossed and recrossed_ and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three lines now fast to him_ that they foreshortened_ and_ of themselves_ warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him_ though now for a moment the whale drew aside a little_ as if to rally for a more tremendous charge_ seizing that opportunity_ ahab first paid out more line_ and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again_hoping that way to disencumber it of some snarls_when lo__a sight more savage than the embattled teeth of sharks_ caught and twisted_corkscrewed in the mazes of the line_ loose harpoons and lances_ with all their bristling barbs and points_ came flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of ahab_s boat_ only one thing could be done_ seizing the boat_knife_ he critically reached within_through_and then_ without_the rays of steel_ dragged in the line beyond_ passed it_ inboard_ to the bowsman_ and then_ twice sundering the rope near the chocks_dropped the intercepted fagot of steel into the sea_ and was all fast again_ that instant_ the white whale made a sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines_ by so doing_ irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of stubb and flask towards his flukes_ dashed them together like two rolling husks on a surf_beaten beach_ and then_ diving down into the sea_ disappeared in a boiling maelstrom_ in which_ for a space_ the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced round and round_ like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of punch_ while the two crews were yet circling in the waters_ reaching out after the revolving line_tubs_ oars_ and other floating furniture_ while aslope little flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial_ twitching his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks_ and stubb was lustily singing out for some one to ladle him up_ and while the old man_s line_now parting_admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to rescue whom he could__in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand concreted perils__ahab_s yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards heaven by invisible wires__as_ arrow_like_ shooting perpendicularly from the sea_ the white whale dashed his broad forehead against its bottom_ and sent it_ turning over and over_ into the air_ till it fell again_gunwale downwards_and ahab and his men struggled out from under it_ like seals from a sea_side cave_ the first uprising momentum of the whale_modifying its direction as he struck the surface_involuntarily launched him along it_ to a little distance from the centre of the destruction he had made_ and with his back to it_ he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from side to side_ and whenever a stray oar_ bit of plank_ the least chip or crumb of the boats touched his skin_ his tail swiftly drew back_ and came sideways smiting the sea_ but soon_ as if satisfied that his work for that time was done_ he pushed his pleated forehead through the ocean_ and trailing after him the intertangled lines_ continued his leeward way at a traveller_s methodic pace_ as before_ the attentive ship having descried the whole fight_ again came bearing down to the rescue_ and dropping a boat_ picked up the floating mariners_ tubs_ oars_ and whatever else could be caught at_ and safely landed them on her decks_ some sprained shoulders_ wrists_ and ankles_ livid contusions_ wrenched harpoons and lances_ inextricable intricacies of rope_ shattered oars and planks_ all these were there_ but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen any one_ as with fedallah the day before_ so ahab was now found grimly clinging to his boat_s broken half_ which afforded a comparatively easy float_ nor did it so exhaust him as the previous day_s mishap_ but when he was helped to the deck_ all eyes were fastened upon him_ as instead of standing by himself he still half_hung upon the shoulder of starbuck_ who had thus far been the foremost to assist him_ his ivory leg had been snapped off_ leaving but one short sharp splinter_ _aye_ aye_ starbuck_ _tis sweet to lean sometimes_ be the leaner who he will_ and would old ahab had leaned oftener than he has__ _the ferrule has not stood_ sir__ said the

round close under the stern_ _the sharks_ the sharks__ cried a voice from the low cabin_window there_ _o master_ my master_ come back__ but ahab heard nothing_ for his own voice was high_lifted then_ and the boat leaped on_ yet the voice spake true_ for scarce had he pushed from the ship_ when numbers of sharks_ seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath the hull_ maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars_ every time they dipped in the water_ and in this way accompanied the boat with their bites_ it is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whale_boats in those swarming seas_ the sharks at times apparently following them in the same prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of marching regiments in the east_ but these were the first sharks that had been observed by the pequod since the white whale had been first descried_ and whether it was that ahab_s crew were all such tiger_yellow barbarians_ and therefore their flesh more musky to the senses of the sharks_a matter sometimes well known to affect them__however it was_ they seemed to follow that one boat without molesting the others_ _heart of wrought steel__ murmured starbuck gazing over the side_ and following with his eyes the receding boat__canst thou yet ring boldly to that sight__lowering thy keel among ravening sharks_ and followed by them_ open_mouthed to the chase_ and this the critical third day__for when three days flow together in one continuous intense pursuit_ be sure the first is the morning_ the second the noon_ and the third the evening and the end of that thing_be that end what it may_ oh_ my god_ what is this that shoots through me_ and leaves me so deadly calm_ yet expectant__fixed at the top of a shudder_ future things swim before me_ as in empty outlines and

by a signal from the mast_heads_a downward pointed arm_ ahab knew that the whale had sounded_ but intending to be near him at the next rising_ he held on his way a little sideways from the vessel_ the becharmed crew maintaining the profoundest silence_ as the head_beat waves hammered and hammered against the opposing bow_ _drive_ drive in your nails_ oh ye waves_ to their uttermost heads drive them in_ ye but strike a thing without a lid_ and no coffin and no hearse can be mine__and hemp only can kill me_ ha_ ha__ suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles_ then quickly upheaved_ as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of ice_ swiftly rising to the surface_ a low rumbling sound was heard_ a subterraneous hum_ and then all held their breaths_ as bedraggled with trailing ropes_ and harpoons_ and lances_ a vast form shot lengthwise_ but obliquely from the sea_ shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist_ it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air_ and then fell swamping back into the deep_ crushed thirty feet upwards_ the waters flashed for an instant like heaps of fountains_ then brokenly sank in a shower of flakes_ leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the marble trunk of the whale_ _give way__ cried ahab to the oarsmen_ and the boats darted forward to the attack_ but maddened by yesterday_s fresh irons that corroded in him_ moby dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell from heaven_ the wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad white forehead_ beneath the transparent skin_ looked knitted together_ as head on_ he came churning his tail among the boats_ and once more flailed them apart_ spilling out the irons and lances from the two mates_ boats_ and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows_ but leaving ahab_s almost without a scar_ while daggoo and queequeg were stopping the strained planks_ and as the whale swimming out from them_ turned_ and showed one entire flank as he shot by them again_ at that moment a quick cry went up_ lashed round and round to the fish_s back_ pinioned in the turns upon turns in which_ during the past night_ the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines around him_ the half torn body of the parsee was seen_ his sable raiment frayed to shreds_ his distended eyes turned full upon old ahab_ the harpoon dropped from his hand_ _befooled_ befooled___drawing in a long lean breath__aye_ parsee_ i see thee again__aye_ and thou goest before_ and this_ this then is the hearse that thou didst promise_ but i hold thee to the last letter of thy word_ where is the second hearse_ away_ mates_ to the ship_ those boats are useless now_ repair them if ye can in time_ and return to me_ if not_ ahab is enough to die_down_ men_ the first thing that but offers to jump from this boat i stand in_ that thing i harpoon_ ye are not other men_ but my arms and my legs_ and so obey me__where_s the whale_ gone down again__ but he looked too nigh the boat_ for as if bent upon escaping with the corpse he bore_ and as if the particular place of the last encounter had been but a stage in his leeward voyage_ moby dick was now again steadily swimming forward_ and had almost passed the ship__which thus far had been sailing in the contrary direction to him_ though for the present her headway had been stopped_ he seemed swimming with his utmost velocity_ and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight path in the sea_ _oh_ ahab__ cried starbuck_ _not too late is it_ even now_ the third day_ to desist_ see_ moby dick seeks thee not_ it is thou_ thou_ that madly seekest him__ setting sail to the rising wind_ the lonely boat was swiftly impelled to leeward_ by both oars and canvas_ and at last when ahab was sliding by the vessel_ so near as plainly to distinguish starbuck_s face as he leaned over the rail_ he hailed him to turn the vessel about_ and follow him_ not too swiftly_ at a judicious interval_ glancing upwards_ he saw tashtego_ queequeg_ and daggoo_ eagerly mounting to the three mast_heads_ while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats which had but just been hoisted to the side_ and were busily at work in repairing them_ one after the other_ through the port_holes_ as he sped_ he also caught flying glimpses of stubb and flask_ busying themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and lances_ as he saw all this_ as he heard the hammers in the broken boats_ far other hammers seemed driving a nail into his heart_ but he rallied_ and now marking that the vane or flag was gone from the main_mast_head_ he shouted to tashtego_ who had just gained that perch_ to descend again for another flag_ and a hammer and nails_ and so nail it to the mast_ whether fagged by the three days_ running chase_ and the resistance to his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore_ or whether it was some latent deceitfulness and malice in him_ whichever was true_ the white whale_s way now began to abate_ as it seemed_ from the boat so rapidly nearing him once more_ though indeed the whale_s last start had not been so long a one as before_ and still as ahab glided over the waves the unpitying sharks accompanied him_ and so pertinaciously stuck to the boat_ and so continually bit at the plying oars_ that the blades became jagged and crunched_ and left small splinters in the sea_ at almost every dip_ _heed them not_ those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars_ pull on_ _tis the better rest_ the shark_s jaw than the yielding water__ _but at every bite_ sir_ the thin blades grow smaller and smaller__ _they will last long enough_ pull on__but who can tell__he muttered__whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on ahab__but pull on_ aye_ all alive_ now_we near him_ the helm_ take the helm_ let me pass___and so saying two of the oarsmen helped him forward to the bows of the still flying boat_ at length as the craft was cast to one side_ and ran ranging along with the white whale_s flank_ he seemed strangely oblivious of its advance_as the whale sometimes will_and ahab was fairly within the smoky mountain mist_ which_ thrown off from the whale_s spout_ curled round his great_ monadnock hump_ he was even thus close to him_ when_ with body arched back_ and both arms lengthwise high_lifted to the poise_ he darted his fierce iron_ and his far fiercer curse into the hated whale_ as both steel and curse sank to the socket_ as if sucked into a morass_ moby dick sideways writhed_ spasmodically rolled his nigh flank against the bow_ and_ without staving a hole in it_ so suddenly canted the boat over_ that had it not been for the elevated part of the gunwale to which he then clung_ ahab would once more have been tossed into the sea_ as it was_ three of the oarsmen_who foreknew not the precise instant of the dart_ and were therefore unprepared for its effects_these were flung out_ but so fell_ that_ in an instant two of them clutched the gunwale again_ and rising to its level on a combing wave_ hurled themselves bodily inboard again_ the third man helplessly dropping astern_ but still afloat and swimming_ almost simultaneously_ with a mighty volition of ungraduated_ instantaneous swiftness_ the white whale darted through the weltering sea_ but when ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with the line_ and hold it so_ and commanded the crew to turn round on their seats_ and tow the boat up to the mark_ the moment the treacherous line felt that double strain and tug_ it snapped in the empty air_ _what breaks in me_ some sinew cracks___tis whole again_ oars_ oars_ burst in upon him__ hearing the tremendous rush of the sea_crashing boat_ the whale wheeled round to present his blank forehead at bay_ but in that evolution_ catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship_ seemingly seeing in it the source of all his persecutions_ bethinking it_it may be_a larger and nobler foe_ of a sudden_ he bore down upon its advancing prow_ smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam_ ahab staggered_ his hand smote his forehead_ _i grow blind_ hands_ stretch out before me that i may yet grope my way_ is_t night__ _the whale_ the ship__ cried the cringing oarsmen_ _oars_ oars_ slope downwards to thy depths_ o sea_ that ere it be for ever too late_ ahab may slide this last_ last time upon his mark_ i see_ the ship_ the ship_ dash on_ my men_ will ye not save my ship__ but as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the sledge_hammering seas_ the before whale_smitten bow_ends of two planks burst through_ and in an instant almost_ the temporarily disabled boat lay nearly level with the waves_ its half_wading_ splashing crew_ trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water_ meantime_ for that one beholding instant_ tashtego_s mast_head hammer remained suspended in his hand_ and the red flag_ half_wrapping him as with a plaid_ then streamed itself straight out from him_ as his own forward_flowing heart_ while starbuck and stubb_ standing upon the bowsprit beneath_ caught sight of the down_coming monster just as soon as he_ _the whale_ the whale_ up helm_ up helm_ oh_ all ye sweet powers of air_ now hug me close_ let not starbuck die_ if die he must_ in a woman_s fainting fit_ up helm_ i say_ye fools_ the jaw_ the jaw_ is this the end of all my bursting prayers_ all my life_long fidelities_ oh_ ahab_ ahab_ lo_ thy work_ steady_ helmsman_ steady_ nay_ nay_ up helm again_ he turns to meet us_ oh_ his unappeasable brow drives on towards one_ whose duty tells him he cannot depart_ my god_ stand by me now__ _stand not by me_ but stand under me_ whoever you are that will now help stubb_ for stubb_ too_ sticks here_ i grin at thee_ thou grinning whale_ who ever helped stubb_ or kept stubb awake_ but stubb_s own unwinking eye_ and now poor stubb goes to bed upon a mattrass that is all too soft_ would it were stuffed with brushwood_ i grin at thee_ thou grinning whale_ look ye_ sun_ moon_ and stars_ i call ye assassins of as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost_ for all that_ i would yet ring glasses with ye_ would ye but hand the cup_ oh_ oh_ oh_ oh_ thou grinning whale_ but there_ll be plenty of gulping soon_ why fly ye not_ o ahab_ for me_ off shoes and jacket to it_ let stubb die in his drawers_ a most mouldy and over salted death_ though__cherries_ cherries_ cherries_ oh_ flask_ for one red cherry ere we die__ _cherries_ i only wish that we were where they grow_ oh_ stubb_ i hope my poor mother_s drawn my part_pay ere this_ if not_ few coppers will now come to her_ for the voyage is up__ from the ship_s bows_ nearly all the seamen now hung inactive_ hammers_ bits of plank_ lances_ and harpoons_ mechanically retained in their hands_ just as they had darted from their various employments_ all their enchanted eyes intent upon the whale_ which from side to side strangely vibrating his predestinating head_ sent a broad band of overspreading semicircular foam before him as he rushed_ retribution_ swift vengeance_ eternal malice were in his whole aspect_ and spite of all that mortal man could do_ the solid white buttress of his forehead smote the ship_s starboard bow_ till men and timbers reeled_ some fell flat upon their faces_ like dislodged trucks_ the heads of the harpooneers aloft shook on their bull_like necks_ through the breach_ they heard the waters pour_ as mountain torrents down a flume_ _the ship_ the hearse__the second hearse__ cried ahab from the boat_ _its wood could only be american__ diving beneath the settling ship_ the whale ran quivering along its keel_ but turning under water_ swiftly shot to the surface again_ far off the other bow_ but within a few yards of ahab_s boat_ where_ for a time_ he lay quiescent_ _i turn my body from the sun_ what ho_ tashtego_ let me hear thy hammer_ oh_ ye three unsurrendered spires of mine_ thou uncracked keel_ and only god_bullied hull_ thou firm deck_ and haughty helm_ and pole_pointed prow__death_glorious ship_ must ye then perish_ and without me_ am i cut off from the last fond pride of meanest shipwrecked captains_ oh_ lonely death on lonely life_ oh_ now i feel my topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief_ ho_ ho_ from all your furthest bounds_ pour ye now in_ ye bold billows of my whole foregone life_ and top this one piled comber of my death_ towards thee i roll_ thou all_destroying but unconquering whale_ to the last i grapple with thee_ from hell_s heart i stab at thee_ for hate_s sake i spit my last breath at thee_ sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool_ and since neither can be mine_ let me then tow to pieces_ while still chasing thee_ though tied to thee_ thou damned whale_ thus_ i give up the spear__ the harpoon was darted_ the stricken whale flew forward_ with igniting velocity the line ran through the grooves__ran foul_ ahab stooped to clear it_ he did clear it_ but the flying turn caught him round the neck_ and voicelessly as turkish mutes bowstring their victim_ he was shot out of the boat_ ere the crew knew he was gone_ next instant_ the heavy eye_splice in the rope_s final end flew out of the stark_empty tub_ knocked down an oarsman_ and smiting the sea_ disappeared in its depths_ for an instant_ the tranced boat_s crew stood still_ then turned_ _the ship_ great god_ where is the ship__ soon they through dim_ bewildering mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom_ as in the gaseous fata morgana_ only the uppermost masts out of water_ while fixed by infatuation_ or fidelity_ or fate_ to their once lofty perches_ the pagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking lookouts on the sea_ and now_ concentric circles seized the lone boat itself_ and all its crew_ and each floating oar_ and every lance_pole_ and spinning_ animate and inanimate_ all round and round in one vortex_ carried the smallest chip of the pequod out of sight_ but as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the sunken head of the indian at the mainmast_ leaving a few inches of the erect spar yet visible_ together with long streaming yards of the flag_ which calmly undulated_ with ironical coincidings_ over the destroying billows they almost touched__at that instant_ a red arm and a hammer hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air_ in the act of nailing the flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar_ a sky_hawk that tauntingly had followed the main_truck downwards from its natural home among the stars_ pecking at the flag_ and incommoding tashtego there_ this bird now chanced to intercept its broad fluttering wing between the hammer and the wood_ and simultaneously feeling that etherial thrill_ the submerged savage beneath_ in his death_gasp_ kept his hammer frozen there_ and so the bird of heaven_ with archangelic shrieks_ and his imperial beak thrust upwards_ and his whole captive form folded in the flag of ahab_ went down with his ship_ which_ like satan_ would not sink to hell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her_ and helmeted herself with it_ now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf_ a sullen white surf beat against its steep sides_ then all collapsed_ and the great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago_ epilogue _and i only am escaped alone to tell thee_ job_ the drama_s done_ why then here does any one step forth__because one did survive the wreck_ it so chanced_ that after the parsee_s disappearance_ i was he whom the fates ordained to take the place of ahab_s bowsman_ when that bowsman assumed the vacant post_ the same_ who_ when on the last day the three men were tossed from out of the rocking boat_ was dropped astern_ so_ floating on the margin of the ensuing scene_ and in full sight of it_ when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me_ i was then_ but slowly_ drawn towards the closing vortex_ when i reached it_ it had subsided to a creamy pool_ round and round_ then_ and ever contracting towards the button_like black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling circle_ like another ixion i did revolve_ till_ gaining that vital centre_ the black bubble upward burst_ and now_ liberated by reason of its cunning spring_ and_ owing to its great buoyancy_ rising with great force_ the coffin life_buoy shot lengthwise from the sea_ fell over_ and floated by my side_ buoyed up by that coffin_ for almost one whole day and night_ i floated on a soft and dirgelike main_ the unharming sharks_ they glided by as if with padlocks on their mouths_ the savage sea_hawks sailed with sheathed beaks_ on the second day_ a sail drew near_ nearer_ and picked me up at last_ it was the devious_cruising rachel_ that in her retracing search after her missing children_ only found another orphan_
